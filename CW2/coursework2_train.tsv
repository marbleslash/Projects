728680557	Tenth bishop signs ‘Profession of Immutable Truths’ in defense of marriage	non-propaganda	Ordained to the priesthood in 1961, Fischer headed the Marriage and Family Centre of the Feldkirch diocese from 1979 to 1990.

728680557	Tenth bishop signs ‘Profession of Immutable Truths’ in defense of marriage	propaganda	Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world’s 5,000 bishops would be “a stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.”

757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	propaganda	A West Virginia school has come under fire for instructing junior high students to write the Islamic profession of faith ostensibly to practice calligraphy.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	propaganda	Rich Penkoski, a Christian parent and founder of online ministry Warriors for Christ, raised alarms over a packet on Islam his daughter’s seventh grade social studies teacher issued to students, according to Christian Post.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	The packet, edited from the full version of a world religions workbook, instructed students to practice writing the Shahada, or Islamic profession of faith, in Arabic calligraphy — an assignment that, if left undone, would result in detention, according to Penkoski’s daughter.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	propaganda	The Shahada states: “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.” Penkoski called Mountain Ridge Middle School Principal Ron Branch and objected to the packet, saying it disturbed him and had misinformation about the history of calligraphy.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	“I saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	Their excuse was calligraphy,” Penkoski told The Christian Post.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	“I was like, ‘Whoa!
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	Whoa!
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	Whoa!’ First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	propaganda	The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.” “I said, ‘That is not happening.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	My daughter is not doing that.’ My daughter told me that if she didn’t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip,” Penkoski added….
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	There were two different calligraphy assignments — one involving the Shahada and another instructing students to practice writing English letters in calligraphy, Branch told Christian Post.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	Hinson “told the students that they could do these activities if they wanted,” Branch claimed.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	“The teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents,” Branch added.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	Penkoski claimed the teacher sent students home with the same packet the day after he lodged a complaint — this time, with certain sections crossed out but still including the Shahada assignment.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	Penkoksi called the principal again and confronted Hinson over the phone.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	“I said, ‘This is not OK in asking my kid to write down the Shahada.’ The teacher happened to walk-in and said she made it an option and that the kids didn’t have to do it.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	My daughter conflicted that story and said, ‘No, that is not what was said.’ What was said was, ‘Do the assignment; and if you want to learn more about the Quran, ask your parents,’” Penkoski told Christian Post.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	Each religion studied in the class, including Christianity and Judaism, received “equitable treatment,” Branch also told Christian Post.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	He said the class spent a week and a half on Christianity and Judaism — other religions took one week — and discussed each religion’s beliefs, history and practices.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	During the section on Christianity, “Jesus was taught,” Branch claimed.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	“The students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity’s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, and salvation.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	They also discussed the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper and Jesus’ Betrayal, the Trinity, and the Lord’s Prayer, among other topics,” Branch said.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	Penkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch’s claims.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	The Lord’s Prayer was not taught, and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus, they told Christian Post.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	“We did [the unit on Christianity] over a week and two days.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	We watched two different videos.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	We didn’t finish them.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	They taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments, Peter and Paul,” Brielle explained.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	“We learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	We were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus.” Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	While the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran, the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements, he said.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	“Notice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord’s Prayer,” he said.
757243988	West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah	non-propaganda	“[There’s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet,” he added….

781768042	Sodom and Gomorrah was Judged by God Because Men Refused to Keep His Commandments in Dealing with the Wicked!	non-propaganda	is that it was homosexuality.
781768042	Sodom and Gomorrah was Judged by God Because Men Refused to Keep His Commandments in Dealing with the Wicked!	non-propaganda	That is how the term ”sodomy” came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced.
781768042	Sodom and Gomorrah was Judged by God Because Men Refused to Keep His Commandments in Dealing with the Wicked!	non-propaganda	Clearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities.

781768042	Sodom and Gomorrah was Judged by God Because Men Refused to Keep His Commandments in Dealing with the Wicked!	non-propaganda	The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.

721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	Apparently, They Think We are Fools
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	As Pope Francis continues his five-year-long tirade against the imaginary Catholic Pharisees who defend the Church’s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage and the integrally related Eucharistic discipline—he is still at it as of yesterday (January 9)—he and his collaborators are busily engineering neo-Pharisaical escape hatches from the negative precepts of the divine and natural law emanating from the Sixth Commandment.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Determined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion, Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium® on his outrageous opinion that in “complex circumstances” wherein it is not “feasible” to live as brother and sister, two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra-marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill-defined “process of discernment.” As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed, this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they “discern” that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	Do they think we are fools?
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Then there is the endlessly double-talking Cardinal Müller.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	In a recent interview concerning Rocco Buttiglione’s verbal contortions aimed at demonstrating that the administration of Holy Communion to public adulterers is consistent with the Church’s bimillenial prohibition of precisely that, Müller proposed this preposterous “solution” to a “problem” that does not exist:
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	It is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience, and with good reasons, of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	In this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament, certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	The Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	No Catholic, whether or not he consults a priest, can declare for himself that his marriage in the Church was invalid, especially when—indeed because—he lacks canonical proof of invalidity.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Moreover, absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal, a purported “second marriage” can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	Cardinal Burke, whom Francis sacked as head of the Church’s highest tribunal because he was a major impediment to the conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia (AL), has observed the obvious in this regard:
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Such cases do not exist.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	No priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Marriage is a public state in the Church, and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	If a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of nullity, how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question?
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	The only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live “as brother and sister”, that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Even then, the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known, lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Does Cardinal Müller think we are fools?
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Some of us apparently are, or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo-Pharisaical sophistry that would produce “a discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.”
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	Apparently, they think they can fool us in the next phase of the program of moral subversion that this incredible Pope seriously expects us to believe is an imperative of “mercy”: the justification of contraception in “complex cases” to which “discernment” must be applied.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Consider the recent declaration by one of Francis’s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life, whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	In a lecture at the Gregorian, one Father Maurizio Chiodi, a “moral theologian” of the post-Vatican II variety, proposed that “an artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out, not in order to radically reject the gift of a child, but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality.”
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	That is, Francis’s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept!
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	Chiodi’s sole “authority” for this lie from the pit of hell is nothing more than Chapter 8 of AL, the only document of its kind in the entire history of the Church.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	AL will doubtless be providing cover for a whole new line of Authentic Magisterium® products, all of which will be utter fakes, including some form of “pastoral integration” of homosexual unions.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	Evidently, they do think we are fools or willing to play the fool in exchange for the benefits of respectable conformity in the midst of an unparalleled debacle for the Church.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	(Consider the example of Catholic Answers, which “defends the Faith” while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	Silence at best is the price it must pay for remaining in good standing with the pro-homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego.)
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	But we are not fools.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	And God will not be mocked.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	propaganda	Francis and all his designs will ultimately come to nothing.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, ours is but to keep the Faith and protest before God and man the blows now raining down against the Church, even when they come from a wayward Roman Pontiff at her summit.
721406153	Apparently, They Think We are Fools	non-propaganda	Indeed, especially then.

729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	The McGill student at the centre of anti-Semitic allegations says he’s certain the climate within student government will improve, after a report into the incident was made public this week.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	Noah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students’ Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro-Israel viewpoints.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	They were since reinstated.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	A report made public this week by Spencer Boudreau concluded he could not determine if students who organized against the three board members had anti-Semitic intentions.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	Boudreau, a retired professor of education and former ombudsperson for students, however, said he understood why the students felt they were targeted because they are Jewish.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	After criticism from several Jewish groups both on and off campus, Boudreau issued a clarification to the report, saying he could not determine if the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism, but he acknowledged there were “in fact anti-Semitic effects felt by members of the Jewish community.”
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	Speaking to the Montreal Gazette on Friday, Lew, the SSMU’s vice-president of finance for the Arts, said he was initially upset with the report, but felt vindicated by Boudreau’s clarification.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	“I thought this acknowledgement was very important and I really did appreciate that he clarified the matter,” he said.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	Jewish groups had criticized Boudreau’s report, saying it ignored anti-Semitic language used on Facebook by a group called Democratize SSMU.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	propaganda	The group was urging students to vote against Lew, and two other board members who were deemed to be pro-Israel, alleging “layers of corruption” within the student government and favouritism in appointing board members, then singled out three members of the board “who are all either fellows at the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee, an organization whose explicit mandate is to promote pro-Israel discourse in Canadian politics, or primary organizers for the anti-BDS initiative at McGill.”
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	Boudreau made his clarification after it was pointed out the anti-Semitic language was published prior to the vote.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	While Democratize SSMU later apologized for the language and deleted it from its site, the damage had already been done, Boudreau concluded.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	Lew said he feels vindicated to some extent, but is concerned anti-Semitism is still a problem within student government.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	“There have been some steps taken by the administration and the student body in the right direction, but it’s certainly not over,” he said.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	propaganda	In the months leading up to the vote, there had been other anti-Semitic incidents, including a tweet by Igor Sadikov, an elected representative of students in McGill’s faculty of arts, saying: “punch a zionist.”
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	Among the measures taken by SSMU after the October vote was the creation of a committee looking into the issue of anti-Semitism within the student government, which Lew sits on.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	On Wednesday, McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier said the University wants to ensure a safe space for all students.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	propaganda	“I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses.”
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	In addition to ordering the report, Fortier set up a hotline to report incidents of of intolerance and a task force to investigate incidents of academic freedom and equity.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	Rabbi Reuben Poupko, the co-chair for Quebec of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said it should be noted McGill in general is a safe space for Jewish students.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	propaganda	However, he said any Jewish students thinking of being involved in student politics or activism “will have encounters that are profoundly disturbing and unpleasant.”
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	propaganda	He said McGill is not alone in this respect, as this is a continent-wide phenomenon within student politics.
729651527	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government	non-propaganda	Democratize SSMU did not respond to a request for an interview.

771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	He fired them, and got a new legal team.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	Wired has the story.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	propaganda	Instead, Wilson has spent the last years on an unlikely project for an anarchist: Not simply defying or skirting the law but taking it to court and changing it.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	In doing so, he has now not only defeated a legal threat to his own highly controversial gunsmithing project.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	propaganda	He may have also unlocked a new era of digital DIY gunmaking that further undermines gun control across the United States and the world—another step toward Wilson's imagined future where anyone can make a deadly weapon at home with no government oversight.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	Two months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	Wilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim: They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D-printable data, the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	By blurring the line between a gun and a digital file, Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First.

771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	It promises to change the export control rules surrounding any firearm below .50 caliber—with a few exceptions like fully automatic weapons and rare gun designs that use caseless ammunition—and move their regulation to the Commerce Department, which won't try to police technical data about the guns posted on the public internet.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	In the meantime, it gives Wilson a unique license to publish data about those weapons anywhere he chooses.

771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	BELLEVUE, WA – The Department of Justice and Second Amendment Foundation have reached a settlement in SAF’s lawsuit on behalf of Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over free speech issues related to 3-D files and other information that may be used to manufacture lawful firearms.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	propaganda	SAF and Defense Distributed had filed suit against the State Department under the Obama administration, challenging a May 2013 attempt to control public speech as an export under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), a Cold War-era law intended to control exports of military articles.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	Under terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	The government has also agreed to pay a significant portion of the plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees, and to return $10,000 in State Department registration dues paid by Defense Distributed as a result of the prior restraint.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	Significantly, the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	propaganda	“Not only is this a First Amendment victory for free speech, it also is a devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby,” noted SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	“For years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called ‘weapons of war,’ and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	“Under this settlement,” he continued, “the government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	They will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	That will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.” The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation’s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	Founded in 1974, The Foundation has grown to more than 600,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	What does all this mean?
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	propaganda	Well, it's pretty simple, and I highly recommend the Wired article, which is quite lengthy and has lots of information, but what this does is demonstrates that the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing Communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	Why?
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	Because now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	That's right, and it's perfectly legal to do so.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	And we aren't just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	We're talking ARs, 1911s and a host of other guns.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	This actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future, as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	propaganda	Wilson boasted that his efforts have officially killed gun control.
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	propaganda	"""I barely put a million bucks into this and I got you the Second Amendment forever,"" he told The Daily Wire in a phone interview."

771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	"I don't know that I would go quite that far, after all, the settlement does state that ""the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military."""
771879020	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment	non-propaganda	Therefore, the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms, which it does not have authority to do.

755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	The Trump administration is examining a new plan to help Iranians fighting the hardline regime in Iran following America's exit from the landmark nuclear deal and reimposition of harsh economic sanctions that could topple a regime already beset by protests and a crashing economy, according to a copy of the plan obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	The three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton—a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change—entered the White House.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Ah, yes, John Bolton.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	While I applaud Bolton for his willingness to call Islamic jihadis just that, I am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations has no effect in this decision.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	"""The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,"" SSG writes in the paper."

755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Well, why is that?
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	It's due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	As has been pointed out before, sanctions hurt the people, not the governments that lead them and then those same governments use the effects to propagandize the people against those who are ordering the sanctions.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	I'm not saying the Iranian government is good, but it is Iran's government.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Honestly, I see a ton of corruption and warmongering in our own government that rivals some of that of governments that America stands against.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Still, as was pointed out by Matt Agorist, Bolton told an audience of the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran:
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	propaganda	The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	And that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	And again, this really has nothing to do with the US.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,” said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“Prior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	It’s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place.”
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	The source told the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior—and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially—until that revolutionary regime is gone,” the source said, adding that “nothing’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.”
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	OK, I get they may pose a danger, but let's look at the reality here.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Those they pose a danger to, namely Saudi Arabia and Israel can both fend perfectly well for themselves and have demonstrated that ability to do it.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	There is no need for the US to be involved in it in any way.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Why should we be fighting a battle or encouraging, funding, and I'm quite sure arming, a rebellion?
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	propaganda	Where is that authorized in our Constitution?
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Simple.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	It isn't.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	I care little for the Saudi government as they help push Sharia and is the land where many of the 9-11 hijackers came from.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	The Iranian government I care for even less, but out of each of those, which one should America have dealt with militarily following 9-11?
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Both, if you're going to go by information that we have a record on.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Why can't America focus on it's own issues and solve those?
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	It's because we are too busy trying to police the world, keeping the spotlight off of those in our government who are attacking our rights and spending us into more and more debt.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	And lest you think this is about the nuclear deal.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	It isn't.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it’s the Iranian regime,” the source told the Beacon.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	President Trump hired him knowing all of that.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	propaganda	The administration will now start aggressively moving to deal with the root cause of chaos and violence in the region in a clear-eyed way.”
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Bolton says it will be accomplished in the next six months.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	propaganda	I don't doubt it.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	propaganda	This will probably end up being another Ukraine situation, something we just don't need to be in, and yes, I know, I'll be called a liberal but honest readers who have followed me for some time know that's not the case.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Notice some things that are taking place in Iran that the plan speaks about.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“More than one third of Iran’s population is minority groups, many of whom already seek independence,” the paper explains.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“U.S.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	support for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.”
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,” the plan states.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	propaganda	“Absent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.”
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	President Trump did made clear earlier in the week that we must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Well, I agree, but that gets real messy when you start intervening in this manner.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“Any public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,” according to the plan.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	“We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.”
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	But the Trump administration has spoken out on other countries where the people want their independence.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Remember the Kurds?
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	How about the people in the Catalan region of Spain?
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	No support for those people, and why?
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Cause it's not part of the agenda.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	I say if the Iranian people want their freedom, let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam, and then let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the Holy Scriptures and stand and fight.
755459860	Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran	non-propaganda	Then, they will be in a position to ask for aid, but only then.

757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	propaganda	“It will target, first, the health staff, the contacts of the sick and the contacts of the contacts.” The World Health Organization has been warning about the “Ebola situation” in Congo, and it appears their only solution is an experimental vaccine.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	An experimental vaccine is one that has never been tried on humans before.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	Ebola hemorrhagic fever, seen mostly only in Africa, is one of the world’s most feared diseases.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	It begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by bloody diarrhea and vomiting.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	Days later, some victims begin bleeding through the nose, mouth, and eyes.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	propaganda	Depending on the strain of the Ebola virus, it can kill up to 90% of victims.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	There is no cure for Ebola.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	propaganda	So, is the Ebola virus reaching a terrifying enough level that an experimental vaccine is warranted?
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	The death toll has reached 26 and the vaccine will be rolled out at Mbandaka, the north-western city of 1.2 million recently struck by the outbreak.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	Since the virus is spread through direct contact, an isn’t airborne, it isn’t nearly as deadly as it could be.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	Read more here about Ebola and how it is transmitted:
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	Initially, the campaign will target 600 people, mainly medical staff, contacts of suspected cases, and those who have been in contact with the contacts, Ilunga said.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	Officials are working urgently to prevent the disease from spreading beyond Mbandaka, which lies on the Congo River, a busy traffic corridor, and is an hour’s flight from the capital.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	propaganda	The spread of Ebola from a rural area to Mbandaka has raised alarm as Ebola can spread more quickly in urban centers.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	The fever can cause severe internal bleeding that is often fatal.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	Meaning, the virus itself doesn’t actually kill.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	The immune system’s response to the virus is what’s deadly.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	ZMapp is also an experimental drug that could aid in the recovery from the Ebola virus.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	But, like the vaccine being administered, it has not been tested for safety or efficacy yet.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	It is not a vaccine – it is a therapeutic drug.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	Of the seven people given the drug so far, two have died.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	ZMapp show “promise,” although scientific results are not definitive.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	propaganda	The risk of Ebola spreading within Congo is “very high,” according to authorities, and the disease could also move into nine neighboring countries, the World Health Organization has warned.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	The WHO, however, stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global health emergency.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	WHO said there should not be restrictions on international travel or trade.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	In the meantime, it’s important to prevent oneself from contracting the virus.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	non-propaganda	Unfortunately, health care workers are at the greatest risk as they try to cull the suffering: which is why they will be the first to get the experimental vaccine.
757843275	EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs	propaganda	For their sake, let’s hope it works better than this year’s flu vaccine.

710376094	Asteroid Will Skim By Earth Days Before Christmas: It Is ‘Potentially Hazardous’	non-propaganda	This would make the Geminids one of only two major meteor showers not originating from a comet; the other being the Quadrantids in January.

774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	propaganda	Often, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact — and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident — perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	On August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported, “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	But it wasn’t true.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	propaganda	At all.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.

774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	Tom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	Sadly, the United States has a tendency to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	And now, a US Army Colonel is predicting that another Gulf of Tonkin incident could bring us into war with Iran.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	propaganda	As President Donald Trump continues to surround himself with neocon warhawks, the drums are beating for war with Iran.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	The rhetoric is becoming so strong, that Trump himself — without provocation — began tweeting threats to the sovereign nation.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	On Tuesday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Colonel Douglas Macgregor addressed the growing prospect of US war with Iran and warned that a new “Gulf of Tonkin incident” could be used to drag us into it.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	propaganda	Carlson mocked the neocons’ claims that Iran is the “greatest threat” to America, explicitly noting that “virtually every attack in America has been inspired not by Iran, but by Iran’s Sunni enemies.”
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	propaganda	Carlson pointed out how the neocons are hellbent on pushing the Trump administration into a new war.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	propaganda	“If there was ever a swamp in Washington you are looking at it — the foreign policy establishment — they are working overtime to ensnare the president in a mess in Iran,” Carlson said.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	“Let’s hope that he understands exactly what’s going on.”
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	Pointing out Trump’s recent attempts at diplomacy with North Korea and Russia, Col. Macgregor weighed in, noting that he thinks Trump will attempt to avoid war with Iran.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	However, he noted that a false flag could be used to drag us into it.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	“I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,” Col. Macgregor said.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	“Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	We should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotage by fake news.”
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	Carlson then pointed out how the Trump admin has reacted to fake news by attacking Syria—twice.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	For those who may be unaware, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	In fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	MEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	They are hardly quiet about it.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.

774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	Coincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies—during this training period—until they suddenly removed them from the list in 2012.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	propaganda	While the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran is outright insane.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	propaganda	To see what US intervention—through military support and the support of ‘protesters’—does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America’s wake.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	To those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	All presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.
774904810	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran	non-propaganda	Now it’s Trump’s turn.

778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	DB: John, what is the latest we know about how Julian Assange is being treated and his current state?
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	John Pilger: His state of health is just about the same, as I understand it.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	He needs medical attention, the kind of treatment you get only in a hospital.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	But it has been made clear to him that if he attempts to go to a hospital he will not be given free passage and he will be arrested.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Since he was arrested in 2010, Assange has not been charged with a single crime.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	His treatment amounts to the most unprecedented persecution.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	Julian could leave the embassy if his own government, the government of his homeland, Australia, applied legitimate diplomatic pressure on behalf of its citizen.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	We must ask ourselves why this hasn’t happened.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	My own feeling is that there is a great deal of collusion between the Australian, the British and the US governments–meant to close down WikiLeaks completely and/or deliver Julian Assange to the Americans.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Recently the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, traveled with senior officials to London and to Washington and raised the whole matter of Julian.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	But they raised it in a way that didn’t support the idea that a government should represent its citizens.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	These people listened to the more powerful governments.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	In Washington they met Mr. Pompeo, who refused to discuss Assange altogether.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	I think there is collusion which amounts to an attempt to try to do a deal with Assange whereby he might be allowed free passage of return to Australia if he shuts down WikiLeaks.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	I think that is very, very likely.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	As I understand Julian, this is something he would not even contemplate.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	But that might be one of the so-called “wretched deals” that are being offered Assange.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Some very strange things are being said by senior members of these two governments.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	The new foreign secretary of the United Kingdom, Jeremy Hunt, said sarcastically that the British police would offer Julian “a warm welcome” when he came out, when he would face serious charges.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	There are no serious charges.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	He hasn’t been charged with anything.

778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Was Hunt referring to a deal which has already been done with the United States on extradition?
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	I don’t know.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	But this is the milieu of machination around someone who has the right of natural justice concerning his freedom.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	Putting aside freedom of speech, the persecution of this man has been something that should horrify all free-thinking people.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	If it doesn’t horrify us, then we have surrendered something very valuable.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	DB: Among those who should be especially horrified are those of us in the journalistic community.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	John, I would like you to explain once again why Julian Assange is such a significant journalist, why so many journalistic institutions have collaborated with him based on the information he provided.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	We are talking about a publisher and reporter who has changed history.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	JP: Nothing in my time as a journalist has equaled the rise of WikiLeaks and its extraordinary impact on journalism.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	It is probably the only journalistic organization that has a 100% record of accuracy and authenticity!
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	All of WikiLeaks’ revelations have been authentic.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	And it has been done “without fear or favor.” Although there has been a concentration on, say, the release of the Hillary Clinton/Podesta emails, or the Iraq and Afghan war logs, WikiLeaks has released information that people have a right to know across the spectrum.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	It has released something like 800,000 documents from Russia, and now WikiLeaks is accused of being an agent of Russia!
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	WikiLeaks’ journalism has covered a universal space and that is the first time this has happened.

778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	The people at the forefront of the uprising in Tunisia credit WikiLeaks for informing them of what their repressive government was doing behind their backs.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	In Venezuela, WikiLeaks released cables which described in great detail how the United States intended to subvert the government of Hugo Chavez.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Some of this was published in the mainstream media, when there was still a collaboration with WikiLeaks.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	The Clinton/Podesta emails, which appear to have made a number of people resentful, were published in the New York Times.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	These emails showed the close role that Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation played in support of extreme jihadism in the Middle East.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	That was a very important piece of information for people to know and understand.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	By doing that, WikiLeaks performed an extraordinary public service, while at the same time making some very serious enemies.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Randy Credico: People sometimes forget that, apart from being a journalist, Julian Assange is a human being.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	You have known him a long time.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Could you give us a feel for the kind of person Julian Assange is?
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	JP: Julian is a very principled individual.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	He feels very strongly about the moral basis of WikiLeaks.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	When he first put up WikiLeaks, he wrote that the whole idea of transparency, honoring people’s right to know, was the central aim of the website.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	He feels that very strongly.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Any attempt to do a deal with Julian to shut down WikiLeaks will no doubt be resisted.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	As a person, Julian is an extremely interesting man.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	He is very well read.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	He studied physics.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	He has a very good sense of humor, and I have often laughed out loud with him about situations that others might consider too bleak to discuss.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	His black humor is a part of his survival kit.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Obviously, he is incredibly resilient.

778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	Are they getting pressure from the United States or are there internal reasons why they want to keep Julian Assange quiet?
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	JP: Everything comes down to the relationship with the United States.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	Australia has an almost totally servile relationship with America, in which its national security structure, much of its academic life and certainly much of its media is integrated into the US system.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	That is not entirely the case in Britain.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Since the loss of its empire after the Second World War, Britain has been eager to play a secondary role to the new imperial power.

778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	The judge’s husband is a figure deep within the national security establishment in Britain who was named in WikiLeaks documents.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	Because there is no serious media examining the whole WikiLeaks witch hunt, virtually none of this emerges.

778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	JP: It’s very simple.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	This is about justice.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	In a famous speech given in the 1930’s by Parson Martin Niemoller, he said that first the Nazis came for socialists, but he didn’t speak up because that didn’t concern him.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	Then they came for trade unionists, but he didn’t speak up because that didn’t concern him.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	He didn’t speak up when they came for the Jews because he wasn’t a Jew.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	non-propaganda	And, of course, finally they came for him.
778139122	Pilger Excoriates Media	propaganda	That might not be a precise parallel, but if Julian Assange is allowed to literally go under, it represents the conquest of all of us.

729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	Scientists say our Sun will likely enter a cooldown cycle as soon as 2050, but the phase has almost no effect on global warming.
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	Physicist Dan Lubin at the University of California San Diego and two of his colleges managed to collect and observe relevant data for the past 20 years and came to the conclusion that the giant burning ball of gas in our planetary system might enter a “grand minimum” period of decreased ultraviolet radiation that would last for some 11 years by mid-century.
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	“The cooldown… [is] a periodic event during which the Sun’s magnetism diminishes, sunspots form infrequently, and less ultraviolet radiation (UV) makes it to the surface of the planet,” researchers noted in a statement earlier this week, adding that “the event is triggered at irregular intervals by random fluctuations related to the Sun’s magnetic field.”
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	The study, whose results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said the Sun is likely to be 6.9 percent cooler than its usual lowest amount of activity in the grand minimum.
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	According to the researchers, the cooldown phase could echo those experienced in Europe in the mid-17th century, called the “Maunder Minimum,” or the prolonged sunspot minimum, during which temperatures were low enough to cause London's River Thames to freeze over on a regular basis and to freeze the Baltic Sea to such an extent that Swedish troops were able to invade Denmark in 1658 on foot by marching across the sea ice.
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	However, scientists warned that it should not be assumed that the ultra-cooling of the sun would potentially prevent the negative effects of global warming.
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	“The cooling effect of a grand minimum is only a fraction of the warming effect caused by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” they said, adding, “After hundreds of thousands of years of CO2 levels never exceeding 300 parts per million in air, the concentration of the greenhouse gas is now over 400 parts per million, continuing a rise that began with the Industrial Revolution.”
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	The study estimated that the Sun’s mid-century cooldown would probably only result in cooling the Earth by some 0.25 percent between 2020 and 2070.
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	As a result, the temperature at the surface of our cosmic home would decrease by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius, which is not sufficient to stop global warming, but it could at least soften its effects in part.
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	“Now we have a benchmark from which we can perform better climate model simulations.
729700539	PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study	non-propaganda	We can therefore have a better idea of how changes in solar UV radiation affect climate change,” said Lubin.

697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	In the article that I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein, we would have done better to speak of the “official” Latin text rather than the “original” Latin text.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	This, though, is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	Mr. Ferrara, however, bases his critique upon an assumption that the “generous response” offered to God is a sin.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	This, though, is not what AL is saying.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	The generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	I explain this in my most recent response to Prof. E. Christian Brugger, which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara:
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Posted on LifeSiteNews:
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Prof. Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man, but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	In his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that “God can be ‘asking’ someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.” Then in a Sept. 28 ‘17 LifeSiteNews article, he states that “the generous response” owed to God is “a certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.” Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains “this conscience” in AL 303, this proves that the “generous offering owed to God” is the recognition that one is living “contrary to “the universal command of the Gospel.”
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Prof. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience’s recognition that “a given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel” and this same conscience’s subsequent recognition of a “generous response owed to God in the present circumstances.” The subject “conscience” might be the same but the object is different.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	The “generous response” is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	What might be this “generous response?” Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he’s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Moreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil “marriage” recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that “the generous response” could be the ending of a particular sin.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	It’s really just the opposite.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	Pope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says “a small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order, but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.’”
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	In a recent interview (http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: “Imagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	He still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	The father is happy.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Is he happy about the fact that the child is sick?
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	No, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.”
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	This is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	God is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	God, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction—even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	It is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	I certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	I certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Rather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	With all due respect to Dr. Fastiggi, his argument and that of Buttiglione, that a “move away from sin” is what is pleasing to God, even if the moral norm is not adhered to, is sophistical.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	What constitutes a “move away” from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin?
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	No example is provided in AL because none can be.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	The notion is nonsensical.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Just how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi’s claim that by “a move away from sin” in the case of a divorced and “remarried” couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	But that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Such a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church’s constant practice, albeit privately to avoid scandal.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	At any rate, the “brother and sister” approach to the situation, which is that of Familiaris consortio 84, is certainly not the one advocated by Francis.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	As my article shows, Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and “remarried” people who will continue to live as if they were married, including sexual relations, while “discerning” their situation, this “discernment” being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Thus, Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines, which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and “remarried” people who believe themselves to be “at peace with God.” And, as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing, “there is no other interpretation.”
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	No amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL: Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church---which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm, not a mere ecclesiastical law, to which everyone is bound in conscience “without exception”---is being overthrown in place after place.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	It is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	A moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause.

697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Thank you for your response.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	You write well but you do not reveal a proper understanding of what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	I can only ask that you to study the matter more carefully with an open heart and mind.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 16 minutes ago
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Tell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio, all of whom you insult with your superficial and I must say entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what Francis is clearly doing.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	Irony of ironies, the latter-day Pharisees and legalists Francis sees around every corner are hard at work defending Amoris Laetitia at the very moment it is being cited by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admitting public adulterers to Holy Communion---while Francis does nothing but approve.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	I think you should follow your own advice about studying this matter with an open heart and mind, but above all with open eyes, for you have clearly shut them to what is going in the dioceses in the name of AL.

697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Robert Fastiggi • 12 hours ago
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	I would like to thank Christopher Ferrara again for calling attention to an article I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein in La Stampa.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	I give him credit for his colorful style.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Unfortunately, Mr. Ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that Pope Francis “wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in 'second marriages' to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations.”
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	He mentions the Holy Father's letter to the Buenos Aires bishops, but he fails to take into account that the statement of those Argentine bishops can be interpreted in an orthodox way, as Cardinal Müller told Edward Pentin in a Sept. 28 interview published in the National Catholic Register.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	In fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of “access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist.” This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	The same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Pope Francis defers to the exposition of Amoris laetitia by Cardinal Schoenborn given in April 2016 when the exhortation was made public.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	I have read the Cardinal's exposition in both Italian and English, and I only find mention of the help of the sacraments in certain cases.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Once again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	With regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Moreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	This seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	As a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	As a Christian, he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Beyond these considerations, I wish to express a personal concern I have about Mr. Ferrara's standing in the Catholic Church.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	He says that Dr. Goldstein and I are “foot soldiers of a Leviathan Church” because we defend the Roman Pontiff.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	Does Mr. Ferrara believe that the Catholic Church under Pope Francis is a “Leviathan Church” and not the Catholic Church?
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	If this is so, then it would suggest that Mr. Ferrara is refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff and communion with the members of the Church subject to him.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	This, though, is the very definition of schism found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2089 and the 1983 CIC canon 751.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	I hope Mr. Ferrara can clarify what he means by the “Leviathan Church” under Pope Francis.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	A more simple question to him would be this: “Are you refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff or communion with the members subject to him?”
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	I apologize ahead of time if I misconstrued his words.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	I believe, though, my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a “Leviathan Church” distinct from “the dictates of the Immortal God in heaven.”

697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	If Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend, despite a growing mountain of evidence, that Pope Francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to Holy Communion--just as he did when Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in Argentina—then I cannot help him.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	As for my metaphorical reference to a “Leviathan Church,” I am afraid Dr. Fastiggi has succumbed to an unfortunate literal-mindedness.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	To make it clear for him, I am contending that he and his co-author treat the Pope as if he were the absolute ruler of Hobbes’s Leviathan.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	I do not, as should be obvious, argue that this Leviathan Church actually exists.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	That it does not and cannot exist is precisely my point.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	Dr. Fastiggi’s inapt citation to Canon 751 and his clumsy and insulting questions about my “standing in the Catholic Church” and whether I am “refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff” demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension of pertinent ecclesiological and theological basics, and a rather embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	non-propaganda	Raising objections to a papal document because it appears to depart from sound orthodoxy is hardly “refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff,” who has not, at any rate, actually commanded anyone to “submit” to anything via AL.
697454736	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara	propaganda	I respectfully suggest that Dr. Fastiggi’s comments evince a need for serious study and reflection before he ventures further opinions on this controversy in public.

715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	Of that book, no less than Robert Royal—signaling growing alarm over the Bergoglian Debacle in the Catholic mainstream— has written : “About 90 percent of it is simply incontrovertible, and cannot help but clarify who Francis is and what he’s about.” And the picture that emerges in stark relief in The Dictator Pope, as Life Site News reports , is that of “a power-hungry, manipulative dictator, [who] celebrated the abdication of Benedict XVI” because he knew what it meant: that the plan to give him the Keys of Peter in 2005 would finally come to fruition in 2013.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	“We elected you to make reforms, not to smash everything!” Thus is Cardinal Leonardi Sandri, a fellow Argentinian and a supporter of Pope Francis at the conclave of 2013, reliably reported literally to have screamed at Pope Francis behind closed doors in the Vatican.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	Sandri would be one of a number of Bergoglian partisans at the conclave who are now said to be experiencing “buyer’s remorse,” as documented most recently in the explosive best-seller The Dictator Pope .

715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	The Dictator Pope even feels at liberty to demand that the Lord’s Prayer be changed to reflect his dissatisfaction with God’s words: “And lead us not into temptation [et ne nos inducas in tentationem],” which Francis has decided, after 2,000 years, is a “not a good translation.” Apparently lost on Francis, given the disordered mélange of bits and pieces of things he has read that constitutes his theology, is the distinction between sin, a culpable act, and temptation, which arises from concupiscence or what Saint Thomas called the fomes, or the fleshly inclination to sin, which grace enables us to control by the rule of reason over the passions.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	But now we are witness to the single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	The Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power, Alexander VI being the most popularly known example.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	But never, before Francis, has there been a Pope who dared to tyrannize the Magisterium itself by attempting to bend it to his errant personal opinions.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	By publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Francis has officially declared that the “authentic Magisterium” includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	The guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis’s private missive, which is suddenly declared to be “an apostolic letter.”
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	The normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	We are now expected to believe that the “authentic Magisterium”—meaning simply and only AL—teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare, solely in reliance on AL:
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	When the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible, especially when both are Christians with a journey of faith, one may propose that they commit to living in continence….
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	In other more complex circumstances, and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity, the aforementioned option may not, in fact, be viable.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Nonetheless, it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment….
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	[I]f one arrives at the recognition that, in a concrete case, there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability (cf.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	301-302), particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union, Amoris Laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (cf.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	notes 336 and 351).
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	As Francis would have it, then, the “authentic Magisterium” has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia:
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	The admission of public adulterers in “second marriages” to Holy Communion, which John Paul II, in line with all of Tradition, called “ intrinsically impossible ” given their objective state in life, is now deemed possible depending on circumstances—that is, situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	The requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament—a moral norm binding “ without exception ” because it is rooted in divine law—is suddenly demoted to a mere “proposal” that may not be “feasible” or “viable” in “the concrete circumstances of the couple.”
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	A valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage, the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse, is now dispensed with in “more complex circumstances… when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity,” the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	The meaningless slogan “journey of discernment” cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church’s sacramental life.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	No less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship, blithely referred to as a “new union,” could be “damaged” if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion—evidently because the “new union” would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce!

715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	As recently as seventeen years ago, during the reign of John Paul II, the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative texts reaffirmed the immutable truth reflected in Canon 915, which prohibits the administration of Holy Communion to those “who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin.” That prohibition, declared the Pontifical Council, applies to the divorced and “remarried” not as a matter of mere disciplinary law subject to revocation or modification, but rather “is derived from divine law and transcends the domain of positive ecclesiastical laws; [and] the latter cannot introduce legislative changes which would oppose the doctrine of the Church.”
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Francis, however, has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the Church.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	The attempt is void, of course, and the appellation “authentic Magisterium” is fraudulent.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	But the consequences of this Pope’s toying with the teaching office of the Church to advance half-baked theological notions, such as “discernment” (a term he borrows from St. Ignatius of Loyola but strips of its original meaning) are catastrophic.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Over the past year, Cardinal Burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon Francis to “clarify” his intention respecting AL.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	That clarification has now been given: Francis intends, if it were possible, to change the unchangeable teaching of the Church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	Even if the attempt is void and of no effect before man and God—an immoral law is no law at all—Francis clearly means to impose his will by fiat, daring invoke the “authentic Magisterium” to cloak his absurd novelties.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	No Pope before him has ever dared to do such a thing.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	So now it must be asked: Where are the cardinals and the bishops?
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	With one or two noble (however inconsistent) exceptions, their response to the Bergoglian Debacle thus far ranges from silence, to active complicity, to—at best—hand-wringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the Church while begging the Pope to “clarify” his already perfectly clear intentions.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	At this point, continued pleading for a Bergoglian “clarification” can only give rise to an impression of disingenuousness, whereas continued silence about the papal origin of this ongoing catastrophe is a standing rebuke to all the hierarchs who know what we all know: that at the epicenter of the chaos is the most wayward Pope the Church has ever had to endure.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	Continued inaction while the laity and a few good priests are left to themselves to defend, as best they can, the constant teaching of the Church against the abuses of a tyrant on the Chair of Peter threatens the hierarchs with a legacy of shame and a terrible accountability before the Just Judge.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Their failure to defend the Faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the Church and the cause of the Gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	The time for “prudence” is long past.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Prudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	The time for hierarchical action is now, before the damage to the Church becomes irreparable.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	The members of a hierarchy seemingly cowed by a papal tyranny the Church has never before seen must rise immediately and give a courageous answer to the challenge posed long ago by Monsignor Klaus Gamber, when an already monumental ecclesial crisis was still in what can now can be seen as merely a preliminary stage:
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Where in our Church are the leaders who can show us the right path?
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	Where are the bishops courageous enough to cut out the cancerous growth of modernist theology that has implanted itself and is festering within the celebration of even the most sacred mysteries, before the cancer spreads and causes even greater damage?
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	What we need today is a new Athanasius, a new Basil, bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against Arianism when almost the whole of Christendom had succumbed to heresy.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Will none of the hierarchs rise to defend the Church as “a new Athanasius, a new Basil”?
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Even the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the Church or at most the “confusion” Francis has caused by not “clarifying” precisely what he has just clarified.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	They avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	That error threatens to overwhelm the Church while they do little more than fret about a situation whose self-evident cause—a reckless Pope in love with his own ideas and filled with contempt for Tradition—they seem incapable of identifying.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Concerned clergy and laity throughout the Catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	But in the midst of that “final battle” over marriage and family of which Sister Lucia warned the late Cardinal Caffarra in light of the Third Secret of Fatima, within the human element of the Church only the cardinals and the bishops possess the divinely bestowed power to repel an assault on marriage, family and the very integrity of the Faith that is now, for the first time in Church history, being led by a Roman Pontiff.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	This undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs—first and foremost in the Church—the duty to act.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	True love for the Church, indeed true charity toward Francis himself, requires of them nothing less than what was required of Saint Paul when the first Pope fell into error that jeopardized the very mission of the Church: that Peter be withstood to his face (Gal.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	2:11).
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	May Our Lady of Fatima intercede to obtain for them the grace of fortitude to do what must be done and what only they can do.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	propaganda	Our hopes and prayers are with them as the foremost instruments of divine providence in the ecclesia Dei adflicta.
715588833	The Dictator Pope: A Call to Hierarchical Opposition	non-propaganda	Our Lady of Fatima, intercede for us!

761968851	National Data | December Jobs—TRUMP EFFECT!	non-propaganda	This helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).

790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	On the eve of a historic Supreme Court confirmation hearing, two more women have materialized out of thin air to accuse President Trump’s high court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual improprieties – bringing the total number of accusers to four.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	Even more eleventh-hour character-assassination attempts may be coming given the enraged Left’s determination to prevent the judge’s ascent to the Supreme Court at all costs.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Whether the claims are true is irrelevant to these people.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Only the seriousness and luridness of the charges matter as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	They don’t care about the victims they create.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Only the headlines.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	The new allegations surfaced yesterday as the Senate Judiciary Committee battens down the hatches for a hearing today to receive oral evidence from the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	The third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Incredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	It gets weirder.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	Kavanaugh was a “mean drunk,” she stated.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	He drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	Swetnick claimed to have been gang-raped at one of these parties in 1982 as a result of consuming a spiked drink that contained “Quaaludes or something similar.” Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at the party at which she was raped, she states, but she doesn’t accuse them of participating in it.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	"In response, Kavanaugh labeled Swetnick's salacious allegations ""ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone."""
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"""I don't know who this is and this never happened,"" the judicial nominee added."
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	A CNBC summary describes Swetnick:
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	A 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"Swetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s ""drink excessively at many"" house parties in suburban Maryland."
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	At the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"She said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in ""abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,"" which ""included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent"" and ""not taking 'No' for an answer."""
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"Predictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either ""immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations."""
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	There is no indication so far that the president will oblige them.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	To no one’s surprise, Trump’s legal tormentor, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, whom Tucker Carlson has dubbed “creepy porn lawyer,” is representing Swetnick.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"""There should be an immediate investigation"" of Swetnick’s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, ""and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court."""
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	The president slammed Avenatti.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	“Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh[,]” Trump wrote on Twitter.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	“He is just looking for attention and doesn’t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!”
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	He rejected Swetnick’s allegations as “another beauty” and described Avenatti as a “con artist.”
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	“All of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,” Trump said.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	"“And then you this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today."""
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	A fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	According to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee:
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	An anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner’s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Kavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Depending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	The newspaper account continues:
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	The transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	And GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Accuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Ramirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	She claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	If Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	It normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Election Day is November 6.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	The proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	Committee Republicans considered the political optics and didn’t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to ask the questions at what promises to be a highly-watched hearing.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	Democrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"“It is going against everything I’ve seen for 44 years,"" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)."
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"""They’re not following normal procedure."""
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	As expected, at today’s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	According to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	But I have never done that to her or to anyone.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"Kavanaugh added: ""I am innocent of this charge."""
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Not surprisingly Ford’s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	“I am here today not because I want to be,” Ford says in her opening statement.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	“I am terrified.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	She describes the nominee as “Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,” and claims “Brett’s assault on me drastically altered my life,” but at the same time acknowledges “Brett did not rape me.”
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	Given that Kavanaugh has already passed six incredibly intrusive FBI investigations, odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Many commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Both women are college professors.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Both claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Ford claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	Only left-wingers and feminists like Maureen Dowd still believe Hill, now an utterly undistinguished politically correct scholar who discredited herself by –among other things— following her then-boss Thomas as his subordinate when he switched jobs.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	An abused person wouldn’t do that.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	But all the lies about Thomas at what he described as a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” had an effect.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	In the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	With all the mud Democrats have been slinging at Kavanaugh, he would be thrilled to be approved by a margin as wide as 52 to 48.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	Conservatives need to remember that the purpose of the Left’s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee, and by extension, the president who nominated him.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	If they can derail Kavanaugh’s nomination, that is an added bonus.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	The Left’s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests:
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Disapproval for Kavanaugh … is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Those surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	The case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent, but the constant repetition of the unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media is clearly taking its toll on the nominee.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	That said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"""If we're ready to vote, we will vote,” Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. “If we aren't ready, we won't.”"
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Obviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation.
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"“We're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power,"" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday."
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	"""And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court."""
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	President Trump quoted the nation’s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday:
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	propaganda	“Rush Limbaugh to Republicans: ‘You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don’t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.’”
790266787	Avenatti’s Freak Show	non-propaganda	Trump is right.

790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	non-propaganda	It has been a month since I offered my testimony, solely for the good of the Church, regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23, 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington, in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital.
790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	propaganda	My decision to reveal those grave facts was for me the most painful and serious decision that I have ever made in my life.
790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	propaganda	I made it after long reflection and prayer, during months of profound suffering and anguish, during a crescendo of continual news of terrible events, with thousands of innocent victims destroyed and the vocations and lives of young priests and religious disturbed.
790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	propaganda	The silence of the pastors who could have provided a remedy and prevented new victims became increasingly indefensible, a devastating crime for the Church.

790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	non-propaganda	Neither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony.
790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	non-propaganda	“Qui tacet consentit” surely applies here, for if they deny my testimony, they have only to say so, and provide documentation to support that denial.
790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	propaganda	How can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony?
790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	propaganda	The center of my testimony was that since at least June 23, 2013, the pope knew from me how perverse and evil McCarrick was in his intentions and actions, and instead of taking the measures that every good pastor would have taken, the pope made McCarrick one of his principal agents in governing the Church, in regard to the United States, the Curia, and even China, as we are seeing these days with great concern and anxiety for that martyr Church.
790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	propaganda	Now, the pope’s reply to my testimony was: “I will not say a word!” But then, contradicting himself, he has compared his silence to that of Jesus in Nazareth and before Pilate, and compared me to the great accuser, Satan, who sows scandal and division in the Church — though without ever uttering my name.
790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	non-propaganda	If he had said: “Viganò lied,” he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own.

790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	propaganda	The pope’s unwillingness to respond to my charges and his deafness to the appeals by the faithful for accountability are hardly consistent with his calls for transparency and bridge building.
790483991	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ	non-propaganda	Moreover, the pope’s cover-up of McCarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake.

795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo expressed confidence Wednesday that the Saudi government could be trusted to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist in a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey — despite the likelihood that senior Saudi officials were involved.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Speaking in Ankara, Turkey, Pompeo offered that support hours after President Donald Trump had mounted an even stronger defense for the Saudi rulers, saying, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent.”
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	propaganda	Together they appeared to signal a shift in White House strategy — earlier this week Trump had warned Saudi rulers could face “severe punishment” — and suggested the administration has decided to help its most important ally in the Arab world defuse an international crisis over the fate of Jamal Khashoggi.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	The dissident journalist, who lived in Virginia, vanished Oct. 2 after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Neither Trump nor his top diplomat offered any new facts or insights in the case.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	But unless authorities recover his body or other conclusive evidence of his death, the mystery may remain unsolved.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Pompeo wrapped up two days of emergency talks in the region — first with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, and then with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara — and headed back to Washington on Wednesday.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	propaganda	Turkish officials have described — but have not released — what they say are audio and video recordings that show the 60-year-old contributor to the Washington Post opinion pages was interrogated, tortured and killed by Saudi intelligence officers inside the consulate.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	propaganda	Turkish officials say Khashoggi’s body was cut up with a bone saw, then taken out of the building.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Turkish crime scene investigators and forensic specialists were allowed to search for evidence in the Saudi consulate and a nearby residence on Tuesday.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Erdogan later complained that the interior walls had been repainted in recent days.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	propaganda	On his flight from Riyadh to Ankara, Pompeo reiterated his confidence that the Saudi government would conduct a “thorough, complete, and transparent investigation,” adding that they will “show the entire world” the results.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	He said Saudi leaders made a commitment “to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official.” He said they made “no exceptions,” including presumably members of the royal family.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Asked if the Saudis had informed him whether Khashoggi was alive or dead, Pompeo said, “I don’t want to talk about any of the facts.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	They didn’t want to either, in that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way.”
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Asked if he believed the Saudi rulers’ repeated denial of complicity, Pompeo said he was reserving judgment.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	“I think that’s — I think that’s — I think that’s a reasonable thing to do, to give them that opportunity,” Pompeo said, “(and then) we’ll all get to evaluate the work that they do.”
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Pompeo refused to discuss possible consequences for those found responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance, reiterating at least three times the “importance of the investigation.”
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Later Wednesday, Pompeo said during a refueling stopover in Brussels that Erdogan had informed him the Saudis were cooperating with the Turkish investigation “after a couple of delays.”
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Turkish officials “seemed pretty confident the Saudis will permit them to do things they need to do to complete” the investigation, Pompeo told reporters traveling with him.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	In a sign that the administration is looking to help Saudi Arabia get out of its dilemma, Pompeo urged Americans to be mindful of the extensive energy, economic and security ties between Riyadh and Washington, including efforts against what he called the world’s largest supporter of terrorism, Iran.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	propaganda	“The Saudis have been great partners in working alongside us on these issues,” Pompeo said.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	“We need to make sure we are mindful of that as we approach decisions” on whether to impose sanctions or take other punitive steps against Riyadh, as many in Congress and elsewhere have urged.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Critics questioned whether the Saudi rulers, who preside over an authoritarian regime that allows little opposition, can be relied on to conduct a credible probe into Khashoggi’s fate — especially without decisive pressure from their close ally, the Trump administration.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Saudi leaders for two weeks denied knowing anything about the Khashoggi case.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	On Monday, they began floating a scenario — initially adopted by Trump — that blamed the murder inside the consulate on “rogue killers,” and then suggested the writer was accidentally killed during an interrogation that went awry.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	Analysts familiar with the desert kingdom said it was likely Saudi leaders were hoping the scandal would blow over and that they could wait it out.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	“We received commitments that they would complete this (investigation), and I am counting on them to do that,” Pompeo said.
795379208	Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case	non-propaganda	“They gave me their word.”

999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	Assange Never Met Manafort.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Luke Harding and the Guardian Publish Still More Blatant MI6 Lies
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	The right wing Ecuadorean government of President Moreno continues to churn out its production line of fake documents regarding Julian Assange, and channel them straight to MI6 mouthpiece Luke Harding of the Guardian.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Amazingly, more Ecuadorean Government documents have just been discovered for the Guardian, this time spy agency reports detailing visits of Paul Manafort and unspecified “Russians” to the Embassy.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	By a wonderful coincidence of timing, this is the day after Mueller announced that Manafort’s plea deal was over.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	The problem with this latest fabrication is that Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Neither Manafort nor these “Russians” are in the visitor logs.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	This is impossible.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	The visitor logs were not kept by Wikileaks, but by the very strict Ecuadorean security.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	Nobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	The procedure was very thorough.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	To go in, you had to submit your passport (no other type of document was accepted).
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	A copy of your passport was taken and the passport details entered into the log.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	Your passport, along with your mobile phone and any other electronic equipment, was retained until you left, along with your bag and coat.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	I feature in the logs every time I visited.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	There were no exceptions.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	For an exception to be made for Manafort and the “Russians” would have had to be a decision of the Government of Ecuador, not of Wikileaks, and that would be so exceptional the reason for it would surely have been noted in the now leaked supposed Ecuadorean “intelligence report” of the visits.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency – who were in charge of the security – would not know the identity of these alleged “Russians”.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Previously Harding and the Guardian have published documents faked by the Moreno government regarding a diplomatic appointment to Russia for Assange of which he had no knowledge.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Now they follow this up with more documents aimed to provide fictitious evidence to bolster Mueller’s pathetically failed attempt to substantiate the story that Russia deprived Hillary of the Presidency.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	My friend William Binney, probably the world’s greatest expert on electronic surveillance, former Technical Director of the NSA, has stated that it is impossible the DNC servers were hacked, the technical evidence shows it was a download to a directly connected memory stick.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	I knew the US security services were conducting a fake investigation the moment it became clear that the FBI did not even themselves look at the DNC servers, instead accepting a report from the Clinton linked DNC “security consultants” Crowdstrike.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	I would love to believe that the fact Julian has never met Manafort is bound to be established.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	But I fear that state control of propaganda may be such that this massive “Big Lie” will come to enter public consciousness in the same way as the non-existent Russian hack of the DNC servers.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Assange never met Manafort.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	The DNC emails were downloaded by an insider.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Assange never even considered fleeing to Russia.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Those are the facts, and I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	I can also assure you that Luke Harding, the Guardian, Washington Post and New York Times have been publishing a stream of deliberate lies, in collusion with the security services.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	non-propaganda	I am not a fan of Donald Trump.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	But to see the partisans of the defeated candidate (and a particularly obnoxious defeated candidate) manipulate the security services and the media to create an entirely false public perception, in order to attempt to overturn the result of the US Presidential election, is the most astonishing thing I have witnessed in my lifetime.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Plainly the government of Ecuador is releasing lies about Assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the USA and UK, and to damage Assange’s support prior to expelling him from the Embassy.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	He will then be extradited from London to the USA on charges of espionage.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	Assange is not a whistleblower or a spy – he is the greatest publisher of his age, and has done more to bring the crimes of governments to light than the mainstream media will ever be motivated to achieve.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	That supposedly great newspaper titles like the Guardian, New York Times and Washington Post are involved in the spreading of lies to damage Assange, and are seeking his imprisonment for publishing state secrets, is clear evidence that the idea of the “liberal media” no longer exists in the new plutocratic age.
999000312	Assange Never Met Manafort.	propaganda	The press are not on the side of the people, they are an instrument of elite control.

770956434	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	propaganda	At the Hammonds’ original sentencing, the judge noted that they are respected in the community and that imposing the mandatory minimum, 5-year prison sentence would “shock the conscience” and be “grossly disproportionate to the severity” of their conduct.
770956434	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	non-propaganda	As a result, the judge imposed significantly lesser sentences.
770956434	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	propaganda	The previous administration, however, filed an overzealous appeal that resulted in the Hammonds being sentenced to five years in prison.
770956434	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	propaganda	This was unjust.
770956434	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	non-propaganda	Dwight Hammond is now 76 years old and has served approximately three years in prison.

770956434	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	propaganda	It should be noted that the protests that took place in Oregon a couple of years ago were a response to the injustice the Hammonds faced.
770956434	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	non-propaganda	"As a result, Robert ""LaVoy"" Finicum was killed by Oregon State Police."
770956434	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	non-propaganda	Those who led the protest were all acquitted of all charges and reporter Pete Santilli had all of his charges dismissed.
770956434	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	propaganda	No doubt, Finicum would have been found not guilty as well, but that's not how tyrants work, is it?

773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Well, it’s been quite a couple of news weeks for the Catholic Church, hey?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	McCarrick, Pineda/Maradiaga, Fr.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	James Larkin getting the boot in Dublin for upholding Catholic teaching on abortion… I know some people are, to put it bluntly, freaking out.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call “the good bishops”.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence RI, - nicknamed the “Good Tobin” in contrast to the “Bad Tobin” and FrancisCardinal, Joseph Tobin of Newark – got quite an earful when he tweeted the other day, “Despite the egregious offenses of a few, and despite the faults and sins we all have, I’m very proud of my brother bishops and I admire and applaud the great work they do everyday for Christ and His Church.”
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	The replies haven’t topped out yet, at 121, nearly all of them expressing outrage at this cavalier attitude toward the revelation that Cardinal McCarrick has been proven to be a life-long homosexual rapist and sexual predator, grooming and trapping young men and children into unwanted sexual contact; and that nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	It’s clear that even the “good bishops” have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	As I wrote elsewhere, since 2002, most Catholics know perfectly well, despite the lame whitewashing attempt, that “the US bishops gave themselves a pass” on clerical sex abuse with the Dallas Charter “a thing that brazenly shifted blame.” And it seems that though they’re still doing this, quite a few lay Catholics just aren’t having it.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	We are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	The Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The McCarrick news – and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga – has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	The scandal of McCarrick is simply a toxic emission, a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Rod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	It has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one “bad apple” or even only a “few” as the hapless “conservative” Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	This is the result of a mass-collusion.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	As our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, “We’ve got to stop pretending it’s just the progressive element in the Church.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The ‘conservatives’ are complicit, too.” In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Whether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the “New Church.”
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	A point that Dreher’s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic: the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the Catholic hierarchy (and don’t imagine this is confined to the United States or even to the English speaking world) have a well documented methodology of mutual protection-and-threat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	In briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2].
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	When that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	This is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	As Dreher reported,
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	When predatory gay priests run seminaries, they select on a bias for gay candidates...
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Gay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	If they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared… And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Later, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	When I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men — priests, former priests, seminarians — who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Nothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	For many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I’ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	How are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Where are they to live?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	How are they to maintain themselves?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	These are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet, who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	As men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	In short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest’s material life.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	And these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Moreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	And with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	He will remain a pariah even among the so-called “good” bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal… (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush/John Paul II.)
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, “We’re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don’t we’ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we’ll be homeless and penniless.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	We’re unemployable in any other field.” And as much as we might be tempted to say, “Well suck it up, this is for the good of souls,” the reality is that these are not small considerations.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Many priests are getting older – many of them with health issues – and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Of course there are some who don’t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Some of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	But I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	As one of them said to me, “The old arrangement was, ‘Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	We’ll house, feed and clothe you and look after your retirement.’ The new arrangement is a perversion of that: ‘Keep quiet and go along with it all and you’ll be fine, but step an inch out of line and we’ll destroy you.’”
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	So what do we do?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	As we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	It’s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	We need to start working together with faithful priests – while there still are some – to help them create practical material alternatives.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	If we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it’s time we all started taking seriously.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	In response to the continued outrages of both “good” and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing “an escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.”
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I responded: “And the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	We could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.”
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	This would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	“begging” those manifestly evil and apostate men not to close a famous and ancient monastic house.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I responded that this was going about things the wrong way.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Catholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, “begging” the hierarchy to maintain the Faith.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	First of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Let’s not give them that, OK?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	There’s already enough “frissons of pleasure” in their lives.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Second, it’s simply not going to work.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	In Germany, in the US, in Canada, in Italy, in Britain… throughout the Church in the 1st world, and in much of it elsewhere, the men in charge of the “institutional Church” – that is, whose names are on the bank accounts – are dedicated to the destruction of everything we want to preserve.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	The wolves are now looking with ravening eyes at the faithful.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	They are, in short, our enemies.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	They’ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	They know it and it’s time we stopped imagining otherwise.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	There’s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	No one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he’s a faithful Catholic.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	We should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	He should own a house or stand to inherit one.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Families have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	And more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Among the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	But most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	How many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Change the oil in a car?

773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The standard cliché of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it’s not even worth memeing anymore.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	How many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong “sexual orientation”?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Every one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Among the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	That’s an economic asset that we can’t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.

773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	One kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	This college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	This is fine, good idea.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	But I asked him what he knew how to do.

773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Can you drive a tractor?” This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	There is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Does a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Wouldn’t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Or for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	If you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Young men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Simply put, they’ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	This vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I’m going to ask, “How sound is your investment portfolio?” The next candidate for religious life, I’ll ask, “Great!

773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I’m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we’re seeing elsewhere doesn’t sound like a bad idea.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Perhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it.

773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	What the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Bishops won’t protect and support good priests?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	Then it’s up to us.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern?

773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	We start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Our goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	They took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Over a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.

773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The museum’s website tells us:
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	“Despite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	With only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Equipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Twelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.” “Hermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	No items were lost during the evacuation.”
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	To keep up everyone’s morale, the museum staff, while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving, continued to give tours and lectures, describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	They understood the value of what they had, and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Does this all sound a bit, well, schismatic?
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Not necessarily.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	Any bishop who can demonstrate through his actions and not just with his tweets, who can prove that he is still a Catholic and not a wolf, is welcome to join us.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	But we’d be fools to wait for them.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Whatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre’s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the “state of emergency” for which he was preparing has come at last.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	And in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The simple fact is that soon there are going to be “vagus” priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	There are going to be nuns and monks without homes, as in the England of Henry VIII.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	I think it’s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	What we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and “beg” bishops to maintain and defend the Faith.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	It’s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Sentiment isn’t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills, no money, no job, (no health insurance) and no prospects.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	propaganda	If it is true that we really are alone in this, then so be it.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	Let’s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	___________________________________
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	[1] Dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored, one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis’ Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	It should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a “difference of opinion” with the group’s leadership, Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	He joined in 1966, was ordained in ’78, and was quickly appointed to a high-ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy, Spain and Ireland until 1983.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	This period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr.

773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	The Farrell family’s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother, Bishop Brian Farrell, who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable-but-officially-reformed community in 2015.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	A recent post to the official Regnum Christi website shows that Cardinal Kevin is still close enough to the Legion-related “lay” organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks.
773937361	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”	non-propaganda	After he left the Legion, Kevin Farrell joined the diocesan clergy in Washington DC and became a protégé of the archbishop, Cardinal Wuerl.

704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	​Despite suffering several public and humiliating reversals in various forums and venues, those pushing for boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel have not dispensed with their pernicious campaign of hate.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	The latest outrage perpetrated by BDS activists occurred at McGill University, where a Jewish student and two non-Jewish students identified as pro-Israel were removed from their positions as directors of the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU).
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	At the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School’s student society.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	He was warned by others who had prior dealings with the SSMU, to keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	This is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	The toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	Lew followed the advice and was elected as a board member.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	His “secret” was intact.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	BDS provocateurs at McGill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against Israel.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	In fact, three attempts within an 18-month period were quashed.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	Finally, in June 2016, SSMU’s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill’s undergraduate student union constitution.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	The Board’s ruling, which is called a “reference,” was then referred to SSMU’s directors for ratification.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	SSMU’s Board of Directors addressed the issue more than a year after the “reference.” Lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	The malevolent BDS campaign at McGill had belatedly come to an ignominious end; or so we thought.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	Lew and two other directors identified as either Jewish or pro-Israel became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	Campus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called “Democratize SSMU” movement.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	But Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	Its raison d'être was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU’s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	As an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against “Zionists.” As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill’s Arts Undergraduate Society.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	Sadikov made light of his “punch a Zionist” tweet calling it a “misguided joke.” It does not appear that Sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated McGill’s Code of Conduct.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	McGill’s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	Democratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew’s ethnicity as a reason for his removal.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	An enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	In October, SSMU’s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	According to Lew, “historically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.” But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	In this manner, BDS/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	It was repulsive display leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	The bigoted BDS provocateurs applauded as Lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	But this time, they may have gone too far.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	Even by BDS standards, their manifestly anti-Semitic campaign antics were beyond the pale.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	BDS activists generally avoid reference to “Jews” by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute “Zionists” for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	But in the instant case, McGill’s BDS campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against Jews.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	The vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	Even SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	non-propaganda	One can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action.
704591553	An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University	propaganda	Judging by past “investigations” conducted by other schools – SFSU, CUNY and UCI, to name a few – I am not optimistic.

111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	For decades, the county’s public schools have offered a weekly Bible class during the school day — 30 minutes at the elementary level and 45 minutes in middle school.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	Bible classes on school time are a rarity in public education, but here they are a long-standing tradition.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	The program is not mandatory, but almost every child in the district attends.

111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	Now Bible in the Schools is facing a stiff legal challenge.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	Two county residents with school-age children argue in a lawsuit that the program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment and the West Virginia constitution.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	Filed in January and amended last month by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the suit charges that the Bible class “advances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.”
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	Supporters are adamant that the weekly class is an elective meant to explore the history and literature of the Bible, not to promote religious belief.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	“My experience with it has been very positive.

111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	Trenton’s parents also find it hard to see why there would be objections.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	“I think it’s a great program mainly because it’s the only chance for some of these kids to even see the Bible,” said Brett Tolliver, 27.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	“More importantly, I don’t know who it harms.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	The kids aren’t forced to be there.”
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	Courtney Tolliver, 26, a teacher in the district, agrees.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	“It’s not teaching religion, but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth,” she said.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	“The kids love it and the ones who don’t participate aren’t made to feel left out.”
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	But the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program’s popularity shouldn’t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	The suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	The suit quotes from one lesson: “If all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.” Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time.

111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	Her daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield, but Deal kept her out of the Bible class.
111111132	A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge	non-propaganda	Even though the class was optional, Deal said there weren’t any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out.

715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	non-propaganda	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	non-propaganda	Given that Pope Francis has, since that interview took place, attempted to make the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL 'magisterial'--an interpretation that allows public adulterers to receive Holy Communion--Cardinal Burke’s reply to my question on January 9th of this year would seem to take on new relevancy.
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	non-propaganda	In my interview of Raymond Cardinal Burke less than one year ago, I asked His Eminence to clarify what, exactly, is the level of authoritative weight of Pope Francis’s post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia.
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	non-propaganda	Now, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, made it very clear to the Catholic News Service on December 5 what the Pope is up to: “The fact that the pope requested that his letter and the interpretations of the Buenos Aires bishops be published in the AAS means that His Holiness has given these documents a particular qualification that elevates them to the level of being official teachings of the church.
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	non-propaganda	While the content of the pope’s letter itself does not contain teachings on faith and morals, it does point toward the interpretations of the Argentine bishops and confirms them as authentically reflecting his own mind.
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	non-propaganda	Thus together the two documents became the Holy Father’s authentic magisterium for the whole church.”
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	propaganda	What Cardinal Burke rightly describes as lacking in any magisterial weight whatsoever—and, in fact, in dire need of clarification and correction— has by papal fiat been declared magisterial, and thus binding on us all.
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	propaganda	Francis made it clear that the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL allowing public adulterers to receive Holy Communion “explains precisely the meaning of Chapter VIII of ‘Amoris Laetitia.’ There are no other interpretations.”
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	propaganda	I would imagine this outrageous overreach of papal authority on the Pope's part would make it ominously clear to Cardinal Burke that the time has come to issue his public correction of Pope Francis's erroneous teaching.
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	non-propaganda	The moment, it would seem, has come.
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	propaganda	Cardinal Burke, please and in God's Holy Name, we beg you to act now -- before Pope Francis succeeds in tearing the Church in half completely.
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	propaganda	We fear that your silence now, in the face of this latest papal travesty, may suggest consent to the claim that Amoris Laetitia is magisterial, and thus prove more damaging than if you had never raised your voice at all.
715790840	"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"	non-propaganda	We thank God for the courage you've shown in defending His Church thus far, and we pray he will continue to bless and protect you as you do what must now be done.

765385479	Julian Assange	propaganda	Last October, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Sarah Ferguson interviewed Hillary Clinton, over whom she fawned as “the icon for your generation”.
765385479	Julian Assange	propaganda	This was the same Clinton who threatened to “obliterate totally” Iran and, who, as U.S. secretary of State in 2011, was one of the instigators of the invasion and destruction of Libya as a modern state, with the loss of 40,000 lives.

765385479	Julian Assange	propaganda	Katrin Axelsson and Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape summed it up when they wrote, “The allegations against [Assange] are a smokescreen behind which a number of governments are trying to clamp down on WikiLeaks for having audaciously revealed to the public their secret planning of wars and occupations with their attendant rape, murder and destruction… The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will.”
765385479	Julian Assange	propaganda	This truth was lost or buried in a media witch-hunt that disgracefully associated Assange with rape and misogyny.
765385479	Julian Assange	propaganda	The witch-hunt included voices who described themselves as on the left and as feminist.

765385479	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	We talked about his famous victory — in the 1980s when, as a young barrister, he had fought the British Government’s attempts to suppress free speech and prevent the publication of the book Spycatcher — in its way, a WikiLeaks of the time, for it revealed the crimes of state power.
765385479	Julian Assange	propaganda	The prime minister of Australia was then Julia Gillard, a Labor Party politician who had declared WikiLeaks “illegal” and wanted to cancel Assange’s passport — until she was told she could not do this: that Assange had committed no crime: that WikiLeaks was a publisher, whose work was protected under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia was one of the original signatories.
765385479	Julian Assange	propaganda	In abandoning Assange, an Australian citizen, and colluding in his persecution, Prime Minister Gillard’s outrageous behaviour forced the issue of his recognition, under international law, as a political refugee whose life was at risk.

694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Wait!
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Wait!
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	It’s all a MISTRANSLATION!
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	Thus, it took more than a year-and-a-half for the Factory to roll out the old reliable “mistranslation” defense to explain away the infamous paragraph 303 of Amoris Laetita (AL), which reads as follows in the official English translation on the Vatican website:
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	In other words, the conscience can “inform” a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking “for now,” given one’s particular “limits.” This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	But it’s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Dawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary.
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	All of the critics of AL are wrong—every one of them!—because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Dr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Dawn Goldstein
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Here we go again.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	So what does the Latin say?
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Here is the paragraph in the official Latin:
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Haec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Yes, and so what?
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Well, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: “what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,” the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	So, What the Pope Really Means® is: “what for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.” So, it’s an offering to God, not a response to God.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Big difference.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	But just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an “offering” to God?
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	It would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one’s “limits” make obedience to the moral law difficult.
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	And that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow: “Pope Francis is not talking about an offering of an objectively sinful action but a gift of self that moves toward God and the objective moral norm.”
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	So, our intrepid presenters of What the Pope Really Means® would have us believe that objectively immoral behavior, which is the best one can do according “the “concrete complexity of one’s limits,” is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self because it moves toward morally licit behavior.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Fastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	What about the English locution “while yet not fully the objective ideal,” which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals?
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Not so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend.
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	Do not all those ignorant critics of AL know that the Latin text employs the phrase “obiectivum exemplar,” which, translated literally into English is “objective exemplar.” They declare triumphantly: “The Latin term exemplar does not mean an unattainable ideal, it specifically means a pattern or model to follow.”
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Give.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Me.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	A.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Break.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	A pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: “(1) copy/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Likewise, the definition of the English word “exemplar” is simply: “an ideal model.”
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Here too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	For if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely “exemplary” rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men—including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery—then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Thus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least “for now” (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an “ex” who has “remarried” and is now mired in the “concrete complexity one’s limits.”
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	So, as Fastiggi and Goldstein would have it, all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven’t consulted the Latin text—including those ignorant Vatican translators.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	According to their proposed “alternate translation” into English, What the Pope Really Means® is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one’s “limits” is “the offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.” Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Indeed, their “proposed alternate translation” reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in “second marriages” to the “perfect objective model.” Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery?
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Are you perfect?
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Then again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	But such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	And Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	No problem here!
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	has been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	But wait, there’s more!
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	Our dynamic translators even provide their own dynamic interpretation of AL to mean that the “offering” to God of which Francis speaks is merely the decision by a divorced and “remarried” couple with children not to end their relationship, which would be the “perfect objective model,” but rather to “live in continence until they may—after the hoped for declaration of nullity—enter into a true marriage.” That is, they would have Francis affirming John Paul II’s Familiaris consortio, which repeats the Church’s constant teaching that continence is required of those who have entered into adulterous “second marriage,” failing which they cannot be admitted to the sacraments.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	But the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in “second marriages” do not have to live in continence, but rather—in “certain cases”—may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a “process of discernment.” As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them “there is no other interpretation.”
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Moreover, the Maltese bishops' “guidelines” for implementing AL, published in L’Osservatore Romano—for which Bergoglio thanked them—declare thus:
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	If, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with “humility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God’s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it” (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351).
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	This Pope’s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	See the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Shaw maintains that AL can be “bent into some kind of orthodoxy.” Perhaps.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	But it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope’s statements into conformity with the Faith.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Moreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers—while others disagree—has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	But Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction.
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	Quite to the contrary, confusion as a cover for the introduction of Holy Communion for “certain” public adulterers by Bergoglio’s co-conspirators in the Vatican and various dioceses is exactly what he was aiming to achieve from the beginning of the whole synodal charade, which was merely a vehicle for promulgation of AL.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	As Shaw observes of AL: “What we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.”
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	In a sense, what Bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy, which could at least be readily identified and denounced as such.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	But Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy—undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally—without the guilt of an explicit promulgation.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	In so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ).
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Honorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	And yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	A similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	In a classic power move, he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke, the perceived leader of the opposition, by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura—the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	And this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta, to which he was exiled after his removal.
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	Will this sop buy Burke’s silence, staving off the feared public correction?
694327499	Wait!	non-propaganda	We will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily.
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	But this move demonstrates—if more evidence were needed—that Bergoglio has never been the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative, but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician, constantly plotting and scheming to get what he wants.
694327499	Wait!	propaganda	That the neo-Catholic establishment refuses to recognize the grim reality of this unprecedented pontificate is but another page in the long annals of its shameful defense of the indefensible to the detriment of Holy Mother Church.

783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	In his eleven-page account, affirmed under oath, the Archbishop, marking a turning point in Church history, declares that senior Vatican officials, including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga, coordinator of Pope Bergoglio’s “Council of Cardinals”, covered up McCarrick’s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	This article was first written to address the neo-Catholic commentator Massimo Faggioli’s attempt , following the Pennsylvania grand jury report and the fall of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, to minimize the homosexual crisis in the Church and blunt the correlative rise of what he derides as “neo-traditionalism.” As my piece was about to go to press, however, EWTN’s National Catholic Register broke the explosive story on the written testimony of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò , former apostolic nuncio to the United States (2011 to 2016).
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Faggioli’s propaganda piece now becomes merely illustrative of the points to be made here in light of this astonishing and indeed providential development.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Regarding Bergoglio, Viganò testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about McCarrick’s history, the dossier of the Congregation for Bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men, and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by Benedict XVI (forbidding residence in a seminary, public appearances and Masses).
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Evidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a “trusted counselor” who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	All of this happened before Bergoglio, bowing to worldwide public pressure, finally—only weeks ago—took decisive action against his “trusted counselor.” McCarrick had lobbied for Bergoglio’s election, along with Maradiaga and the infamous Cardinal Danneels, who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephew,has supported “same-sex marriage,” and advised the King of Belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	As Edward Pentin notes: “all 3 prelates have since been special advisors of Francis or rehabilitated by him.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Viganò concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	As to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	I want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church’s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	At the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: “Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ...
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	We need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.” [emphasis in original] If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church’s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	He followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	[my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ’s flock.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	[emphasis in original]
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Before he was papal nuncio in Washington, Viganò headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	In those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	With Viganò’s testimony, the widespread homosexual infiltration of the post-Vatican II hierarchy, from the top on down, now emerges mountainously into view, never to be buried again.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Even before that testimony, however, the fall of McCarrick and the Pennsylvania grand jury report had already presented a Sisyphean task to neo-Catholic apologists for the decrepit Novus Ordo status quo and the ill-starred Council that launched its installation.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Yet there is little doubt they will continue the same polemic that for nearly sixty years has doggedly defended every one of the ruinous “reforms” that have resulted in a debacle without equal in Church history, even considering the Arian crisis of the 4th century.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Those “reforms” included abandonment of the Vatican’s strict pre-conciliar instruction (1961) that “advancement to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty, since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers.” Today, neo-Catholic commentators, cowed by the demands of political correctness, refuse to state the simple truth that homosexuality is a perversion that precludes ordination as does any other grave psychological disorder.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Kill the Messenger
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	I suspect that not even Viganò’s historic testimony will change the neo-Catholic position.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Quite the contrary, I would expect the neo-Catholic commentariat either to ignore Viganò’s witness, explain away his revelations or, failing that, make every effort to smear the man.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	The campaign to discredit Archbishop Viganò began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Only hours after Viganò’s sworn testimony appeared online, the professional Catholic dissident Sean Michael Winters, writing for National Catholic Reporter, smeared the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, who holds doctorates in both civil and canon law, as “a trafficker in conspiracy theories who mixes fact, fiction and venom,” “more than a little obsessed with homosexuality”—like Oliver Stone, who “was obsessed with the grassy knoll”—“a disgruntled former employee” and “always a crackpot.” Without addressing the merits, Winters dismissed Archbishop Viganò’s “wild claims” about bishops who are “subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality” and accused the Archbishop, along with unnamed other bishops and archbishops, of “speak[ing] about gay people with such hatred…”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Winters issues the dire warning that “A putsch is afoot and if the U.S. bishops do not, as a body, stand up to defend the Holy Father in the next 24 hours, we shall be slipping towards schism long before the bishops’ meeting in November.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The enemies of Francis have declared war.” Notice that for Winters it is not the Church or the integrity of her doctrine and discipline that must be defended against enemies, but only Bergoglio and the regime of novelty he is leading to its final extremity.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	John Allen’s instant analysis attempting to impeach Viganò’s testimony is, as one would expect from him, a bit craftier.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	His opinion is: “Take it seriously, but with a large grain of salt.” Which is just Allen’s more nuanced way of saying: “Don’t believe it.” Allen’s view is supported by such irrelevancies as the fact that Viganò’s account implicates “no fewer than 32 senior churchmen” (so what?
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	), that he “has a history” of “innuendo and conspiracy theories” (a gratuitous assertion unsupported by evidence of falsity), that he allegedly quashed an investigation of Archbishop John Nienstedt and ordered evidence destroyed (an allegation Viganò has immediately and categorically denied with conclusive supporting documents, but in any event a tuo quoque fallacy) and that Allen has “the impression that all this was orchestrated with a political agenda in mind” (the same “conspiracy theory” mentality he gratuitously attributes to Viganò).
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Mark Shea, easily the most insufferable of the neo-Catholic polemicists, has quickly followed Winters and Allen in trying to cast doubt on Viganò ’s claims.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Ignoring eleven pages of detail, written and published under oath, he suggests there has been no “Documentation.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Evidence.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Proof.” Yes, Francis should resign if Viganò ’s allegations are true, Shea admits—a stunning concession coming from him.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Yet, making no attempt to refute Viganò’s account on the merits, he tries to wave it all aside with his usual mode of argument—puerile mockery: “But at present, the eagerness of the Greatest Catholics of All Time to believe and repeat everything their itching ears want to hear about this Pope whose living guts they have hated from the moment of his election only tells in his favor, not against it.” Shea’s ever-expanding opus of digital invective never seems to rise above this sort of crude ad hominem attack: Well, if those people believe it, it can’t be true.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The neo-Catholic propaganda mill will have a very difficult time smearing this witness, however.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Speaking to Catholic News Agency, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington, confirmed that “Viganò said the truth.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	That’s all,” when he stated in his sworn account that Nuncio Pietro Sambi conveyed to McCarrick at the Nunciature in Washington the sanctions that had been imposed on him by Pope Benedict—sanctions Bergoglio ignored for five years until forced to act by a worldwide storm of outrage.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Furthermore, a series of prelates has vouched for Viganò’s character and credibility:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	- Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas has gone so far as to order all the priests in his diocese to read from the pulpit a statement that he finds Viganò’s allegations credible.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	- Bishop Thomas Olmsted of Phoenix, Arizona, issued a statement affirming that he has known Viganò for 39 years, has “always known and respected him as a man of truthfulness, faith and integrity” and that his testimony should “be taken seriously by all…”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	- Archbishop Allen Vigneron of Detroit, Michigan issued a statement calling Viganò’s account “another daunting challenge to our confidence in the reliability of the Church’s leadership, during a summer of devastating news regarding clergy sexual abuse and infidelity.” (The statement has since apparently been scrubbed from the diocesan website.)
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	- Bishop Athanasius Schneider declares: “Archbishop Viganò confirmed his statement by a sacred oath invoking the name of God.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	There is, therefore, no reasonable and plausible cause to doubt the truth content of the document of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	- Cardinal Raymond Burke’s statement declares: “The declarations made by a prelate of the authority of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò must be totally taken to heart by those responsible in the Church.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	"- [And just two days ago, Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco wrote a letter to his faithful which ""speaks to Vigano's integrity and sincere love of the Church.""]"
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	In another setback for the propaganda machine gearing up to impeach Viganò’s testimony, the Catholic Herald has just reported that Cardinal Wuerl must have known full well from Viganò himself that McCarrick was under Pope Benedict’s papal sanctions on account of his sexual misconduct because, as an Archdiocesan spokesman now confirms, at Viganò’s request as then papal nuncio Wuerl had to cancel a public appearance by McCarrick not long before Bergoglio’s election.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The Herald asks the obvious question: “[I]f Cardinal Wuerl was unaware of the sanctions, and unaware of the reason for them, why did he ask no questions of the nuncio regarding the reason for his demand?” The question answers itself, and Viganò’s testimony on this critical point stands confirmed by Wuerl’s own spokesman.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Bergoglio Pleads the Fifth
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Bergoglio himself, however, has already precluded any attempt to impeach Viganò’s testimony.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	During the return flight from Dublin after the “World Meeting of Familes,” he was asked to comment on Viganò ’s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick’s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Bergoglio declined to incriminate himself:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Read the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I am not going to say a word about this.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I believe that the statement speaks for itself, and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	It is an act of trust.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	When a little time goes by, and you have drawn conclusions, perhaps I will speak about it, but I would like your professional maturity to do this work.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	It will do you all good, really.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	In other words, as Bergoglio cannot deny the allegations without lying, he will say nothing at all about them in the hope they will go away—with the help of sycophants in the Vatican press corps and shifty polemicists like Shea, who expects his readers to swallow his explanation that Bergoglio’s refusal to say anything in his defense when asked point blank about the charges against him “seems to me to obviously be the reply of somebody who believes the accusations are groundless…”.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Seems to be.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Obviously.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The American “Gay” Church Expansion
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	While events have overtaken Faggioli’s piece, it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo-Catholic polemic.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	That polemic seeks to shore up the collapsing Novus Ordo establishment lest it give way to the dreaded traditionalist revival.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	But before I address Faggioli’s latest defense of the indefensible, some background is in order, including a discussion of further key details of Viganò’s testimony.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	First of all, as I predicted 16 years ago, because the Vatican under John Paul II had no intention of enforcing the pre-conciliar ban on admission of homosexuals to the seminary “a new bumper crop of homosexual ordinands is guaranteed—and with it a new harvest of scandal for the Church.” That prediction came immediately after the “pedophile summit” of 2002 in Rome, which I attended as The Remnant’s correspondent.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	In answer to my question then head of the USCCB, Wilton Gregory, made an explosive admission reportedby the international press: “it is an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.” The struggle, to the extent there even was one, obviously has been lost.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Sixteen years later, the homosexual predator McCarrick has finally been exposed to the world, stripped of his cardinal’s hat and deprived of any ministry, but only after international media coverage of the Vatican’s semi-secret finding that McCarrick had raped a teenage altar boy 47 years ago.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	If not for that one case, McCarrick’s sixty years of homosexual debauchery might well have gone unpunished in this world and he would have died still possessed of all the phony honors that had been heaped upon him throughout his career as a parasite in the Body of Christ, including the favor shown to him by Bergoglio.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The telling details of Archbishop Viganò’s testimony concerning Bergoglio’s friendly relations with McCarrick before he finally had to cut him loose—details conveniently ignored by Winters, Allen and Shea—are utterly devastating to any defense of Bergoglio.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	This would explain why he will not a “say a word about” Viganò’s charges against him.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	The Archbishop reveals, as already noted, that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he “was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.” Viganò further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi, but were also repeated by Viganò himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Viganò testifies that on June 23, 2013, he obtained a private audience with Bergoglio after having encountered McCarrick at the Pope’s residence three days earlier, during which encounter McCarrick had told him with an air of triumph: “The Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China” (evidently to assist in negotiating Bergoglio’s planned sellout of China’s underground Catholics to the Communist dictators of Beijing).
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Viganò wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	During the audience Bergoglio queried: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” and Viganò replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.” The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	But then, what was the Pope’s purpose in asking me that question: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not….
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	It was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews….
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	He [Bergoglio] knew from at least June 23, 2013 [the date of the audience with Viganò] that McCarrick was a serial predator.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Although he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick’s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action to save his image in the media.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	[all emphasis in original]
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Before his long overdue fall McCarrick, as Bergoglio’s “trusted counselor,” had been instrumental in cementing into place the homosexual-friendly status quo of the American episcopate that oppresses and defrauds the faithful.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	It was McCarrick, noted Marco Tosatti, who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago, where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	And Viganò now confirms Tosatti’s allegation: “The appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.” That is, the normal process was circumvented for these appointments.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Remnant readers may recall that I spotted Cupich back in 2002, when he was the obscure Bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, as an example of what was coming in the Novus Ordo: accelerated degeneration.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	As I wrote back then, with the likes of Cupich in view:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Cupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	He is the very exemplar of the crisis we must still endure….
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Let the thing die of its own excesses, for as the “little synod” [the 2002 “pedophile summit”] demonstrates, the men who control this establishment will never restore it to anything resembling the vibrant Church that a long line of militant, uncompromising Popes delivered into their hands at Vatican II.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	For heaven’s sake, the men who govern the Church today require a Vatican summit meeting to agonize over whether serial child molesters should be defrocked.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	From the Vatican on down, through deliberate decisions and criminal neglect, the servitors of Vatican II have laid waste to the liturgy, the perennial clarity of Catholic teaching, the Church’s militant opposition to worldly thinking, the traditional formation in seminaries, the religious orders, the missions, the trust of the faithful in their own priests—in short, the very life of the Church—and dare to call it a renewal.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	We must no longer subsidize the malpractice of the architects of ruin.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Nor must we join the neo-Catholics in their mindless applause when one of these incompetents attempts to repoint a brick or two in the crumbling façade they have erected to obscure the Church of old.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	As for William (“nighty-night baby!”) Tobin, after McCarrick had arranged for him to become Archbishop of Newark, Tobin, another episcopal booster of Martin’s pro-homosexual propaganda, promptly sponsored a “gay pilgrimage” to his cathedral in Newark.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	And it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal’s hat for his roommate of six years, Kevin Farrell, whom he consecrated a bishop.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Farrell, yet another promoter of Martin’s homosexual activism, arranged for Martin to “welcome ‘gay’ families” at the “World Meeting of Families” in Dublin from which Bergoglio has just returned.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Finally, there is the appointment of the “pro-gay” Robert McElroy as Bishop of San Diego, concerning which Viganò reveals: “The appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: ‘Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.’ McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick’s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.” Like Cupich, Tobin and Farrell, McElroy is an avid promoter of Martin’s homosexual subversion of the Church, calling opposition to Martin symptomatic of a “cancer of vilification [that] is seeping into the institutional life of the church.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Emboldened by the certainty that he will face no discipline whatsoever, Martin, now backed by “Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy,” as Viganò testifies, is urging all the “gay priests” to “come out,” including those ordained since the useless “pedophile summit” presided over by none other than McCarrick as the classic fox in charge of the hen house.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	But Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin’s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	As Viganò notes, it was Bergoglio who made Martin a “Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications,” even though he is a “well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families…”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	“Father” Martin now confidently declares, sixteen years after the “pedophile summit,” that “The idea of a purge of gay priests is both ridiculous and dangerous.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Any purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests and bishops who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Martin thus revels in smug certitude that the future of the universal Church is in the hands of legions of intrinsically disordered homosexual bishops and priests and their homosexual successors, who will perpetuate an existing worldwide homosexual network, and that there is absolutely nothing we can or should do about it.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	A Worldwide Network of Corruption, Beginning at the Top
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	None of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The spread of clerical sodomy has not respected national boundaries but rather extends throughout the Church under the eyes of a Vatican apparatus that is itself thoroughly infested with homosexuals.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	This is thanks in large measure to Bergoglio, who made a flagrantly active homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, “prelate of the gay lobby,” no less than head of his papal household.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Moreover, it was Bergoglio’s right hand man, Cardinal Maradiaga, who sheltered his friend, Juan José Pineda, auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa, from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	When an apostolic visitation, compelled by mounting public pressure, confirmed the charges against Pineda, he was forced to resign, even as Maradiaga dismissed the incontestable proofs against him as “slander.” Viganò notes that “the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Despite the fall of his friend Pineda, Maradiaga continues todefend and protect the homosexual corruption of his own seminary, involving incontrovertible evidence of rampant sodomy among the seminarians he refuses to dismiss, rejecting all the evidence as “gossip.” Concerning Maradiaga, who is also mired in financial corruption for which he offers no credible explanation, Viganò provides this withering assessment of the man and his relation to Bergoglio:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	In a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, [McCarrick] had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops….. By now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga’s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See….
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	First, he insulted the abuse victims.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Then, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	On the very day Archbishop Viganò’s testimony was made public, Sandro Magister summed up the entire state of affairs in the Church universal after decades of unrestricted homosexual migration into the hierarchy, to which Bergoglio has contributed mightily: “From the seminaries, to the clergy, to the bishops, to the cardinals, homosexuals are present at all levels, by the thousand.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Archbishop Viganò now provides his own decisive summary of the situation, based on firsthand experience with a now endemic homosexual corruption of the Church:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Janet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote: “The problem of clergy abuse cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.” These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	[emphasis added]
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Defending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	At this moment, the entire Novus Ordo regime of novelty is threatened with collapse on account of its homosexual corruption, and voices throughout the Catholic world are now echoing Archbishop Viganò’s call for Bergoglio’s resignation, including Laura Ingraham: “Too little, too late from Pope Francis in Ireland.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Time for the laity to demand a new Shepherd.” Even Michael Voris, in a highly amusing example of leading from behind, has finally abandoned his absurd refusal to criticize this pontificate and now declares with a screaming headline: “Pope Francis Must Resign.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Nearly three years ago, seeing what was certainly coming on the disastrous course Bergoglio had already clearly established, this newspaper published a petition which states: “We your subjects respectfully petition Your Holiness to change course for the good of the Church and the welfare of souls.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Failing this, would it not be better for Your Holiness to renounce the Petrine office than to preside over what threatens to be a catastrophic compromise of the Church’s integrity?” Our petition was of course dismissed as “ridiculous” by the neo-Catholic commentariat.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Today, our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	From the neo-Catholic perspective, the events of recent days present a terrifying prospect: the final collapse of the Novus Ordo establishment, an end to the conciliar aggiornamento and a revival of integral Tradition, which growing numbers of young people are seeking.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Hence even before Archbishop Viganò had come forward, commentators like Faggioli were already sounding the neo-Catholic air raid siren.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Faggioli fretted that “[t]he abuse scandal and delegitimization of the episcopate has created a great power vacuum in the Church” that could be filled by the “neo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics” who “attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis.” Accordingly, he rushed to the defense of Bergoglio and his corrupt regime against “a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense...”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	For Faggioli, not only would Bergoglio’s resignation be unthinkable, so also would a purge of the homosexual and pro-homosexual prelates Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen have systematically enabled.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The Pope, he argues, is not “the CEO of the Catholic Church world, and the bishops as its managers whom the Pope can simply fire.” No, Bergoglio cannot “simply fire” bishops.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Except whenever he pleases, as we have seen again and again with the conservative bishops and even Cardinals (Burke and Müller) he has sacked because their conservatism offended him or one of his friends, prompting even Crux to ask: “Does Pope Francis have an enemies list?” Then again, Francis even obtained the removal of his own “trusted counselor” McCarrick from the College of Cardinals, albeit only when forced to act due to worldwide condemnation in the media.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	So, according to Faggioli, the same Pope who sacks conservative bishops and cardinals according to his pleasure and has just removed a cardinal from the College of Cardinals in an unprecedented disciplinary act under fire from the media, is somehow powerless to dismiss Modernist bishops who have created an obscene “gay culture” in the Church and replace them with orthodox, normal heterosexual males.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Francis cannot “simply fire” even Cardinal Wuerl, who covered up crimes of homosexual predation by the priests he transferred elsewhere while Archbishop of Pittsburgh, and who authorized payment of $900,000 in hush money to bury sexual abuse claims against a homosexual priest involved in the production of child pornography.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Wuerl, says Faggioli, “faces a complex situation: on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry… while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases… It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol… beyond the specific accusations against him, from which he could not publicly defend himself.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	In other words, because his situation is “complex” Wuerl, unlike McCarrick, should remain a cardinal and the Archbishop of Washington, DC, thus maintaining a key bulwark against the “neo-traditionalist” threat.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Yet, as the Pennsylvania grand jury report documents, Wuerl assisted McCarrick in the coverup of his crimes and now brazenly lies about it.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Here too Viganò’s testimony sheds light on the darkness:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	….
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	If, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	His recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	However, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	But the Cardinal knew nothing about it!
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	In doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	[emphasis in original]
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	What really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his “complex situation,” which is not complex at all.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Rather, what he views with alarm as an “essential element” of the context in which Wuerl operates is that “scandals are also the opportunity for the neo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics to attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis….” Better a thousand septuagenarian Wuerls in their lavish sties of corruption, financed by the faithful, than a single, young neo-traditionalist prelate!
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	But what exactly is a neo-traditionalist?
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Quite simply: an orthodox Catholic who has had enough of the homosexual-infested regime of novelty imposed on the Church by the old men of the Council, Bergoglio merely being the latest, the highest placed, and one of the last.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	As Faggioli puts it: “In the last fifteen years, the American Catholic Church has been traversed by a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense, especially in the younger generations of priests and intellectuals.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	They interpret the current abuse crisis as fruit of the mistakes of the Council itself and not only of the post-Council…”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Just as Faggioli fears, many in the up-and-coming generation of Catholic clergy and laity recognize the obvious: that the conciliar texts, for all their prolix repetition of traditional teaching, opened the way to ecclesial disaster.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Because in those texts—above all Gaudium et Spes, Dignitatis Humanae, Unitatis Redintegratio, Nostra Aetate and Sacrosanctum Concilium—the Council verbally prostrated itself before “the modern world” and the practitioners of other religions while authorizing Bugnini (Secretary of the liturgical Preparatory Commission that drafted what would become Sacrosanctum Concilium) to begin demolition of the sacred liturgy that was the very foundation Catholic of orthodoxy and orthopraxis.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	To quote Paul VI, then in the depths of his conciliar delirium at the Council’s close:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	But one must realize that this council, which exposed itself to human judgment, insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man, rather than on his unpleasant one.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Its attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	A wave of affection and admiration flowed from the council over the modern world of humanity….
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Instead of depressing diagnoses, encouraging remedies; instead of direful prognostics, messages of trust issued from the council to the present-day world.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	The modern world’s values were not only respected but honored, its efforts approved, its aspirations purified and blessed.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	[emphasis added]
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Thus did Paul describe the conciliar “opening to the world” through which the world promptly invaded the Church, including large numbers of homosexuals who should never have been admitted to the seminary.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	In sum, Faggioli is representative of the thinking that requires defense of a homosexualized clergy if only for the reason that tradition-minded Catholics cannot be allowed to take their place: “This neo-traditionalist Catholicism believes that sexual abuses are committed only by homosexual clergy… and that the crisis of abuse can be resolved by a kind of Catholic Jacobinism that should eliminate all bishops and priests minimally engaged in dialogue with modern culture, and replaced by a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages and the rejection of a Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Rather than “young clergy marked by personal sanctity,” the neo-Catholic mentality Faggioli exemplifies prefers that homosexual priests and bishops be kept in place in order to continue the “dialogue with modern culture.” It is not the integrity of the Faith that matters but only perpetuation of the post-conciliar regime of novelty.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Any abandonment of the regime must be viewed as ecclesiastical treason—“Catholic Jacobinism”—if not criminal activity.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Faggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of “Catholic Jacobins” for “hate speech” than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	“Homosexuality in the clergy exists and is a matter that must be addressed,” Faggioli fleetingly acknowledges toward the end of his piece, “but the abuse crisis cannot be resolved by making homosexuals within the Church the scapegoat of a scandal that has ancient roots, well before Vatican Council II.” And how does the Church “address” a massive infestation by homosexual priests and prelates without removing them from authority and ensuring that they cannot promote homosexual successors for generation after generation?
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Faggioli has no answer because what he is really arguing—the final beachhead of the neo-Catholic defense of their disintegrating regime—is that homosexuals in the hierarchy must remain in authority as an indispensable seawall against a “neo-traditionalist” storm surge.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Faggioli’s argument demonstrates that neo-Catholicism has never been about making the authentic Faith more appealing to a “modern world” founded precisely on a rejection of the Church’s authority.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	It is not about the Faith at all.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Rather, it is an ideological movement dedicated to the face-saving defense of a catastrophic failure in ecclesial innovation that has corrupted the human element of the Church in practically every department.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	For people like Faggioli, indeed for the tradition-hating Pope they blindly defend, the one thing to be feared is that more and more faithful will recognize the neo-Catholic polemic for what it is—a fraud—and begin demanding a return of everything the regime of novelty has stolen from the life of the Church.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	That is exactly what a growing number of Catholics are now doing, as even the secular press recognized less than three months before Bergoglio began his tyrannical reign.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	In this respect, what the neo-Catholics are defending at bottom is themselves—that is, the reputations they have all staked on their defense of the indefensible against the traditionalists they have arrogantly mocked and marginalized for decades only to see, to their horror, that traditionalism is ever more vindicated as the scandals of the Novus Ordo mount under this reckless Pope to an unsustainable, indeed apocalyptic, level.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	A return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Irony of ironies, he is now reduced to defending what is old and tired and corrupt against a restoration, led largely by a youthful vanguard, of what is ever ancient but ever new.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	For some, it seems, no price is too great—not even the good of the Church—to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Conclusion: The Fatima Connection
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Long before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome, the successive Vatican Secretaries of State, Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone, were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	As to Bertone and Sodano, Viganò provides further vital testimony:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Nuncio Sambi’s report [on McCarrick’s sexual abuse], with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	My two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	As already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict….
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information [concerning McCarrick] was communicated to him.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	In November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Benedict reacted, despite Sodano’s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	It is no coincidence that, as I detail in my book on the Third Secret of Fatima, Sodano and Bertone have also taken the leading role in suppressing the integral Secret and reducing the Message of Fatima in general to a generic prescription for personal piety, stripped of its prophetic and admonitory content regarding the epochal malfeasance and corruption of the upper hierarchy to which they belong.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Concerning my book, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Viganò’s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington, whom Viganò’ credits with diligently reporting McCarrick’s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict’s sanctions to McCarrick, made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan, published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	We were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima, the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia, and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	Sambi said, “Excuse me.” He got up, went out of the room, and came back with a book.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	“Here,” he said.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	“Do you know this book?
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	You should read it.” It was Christopher Ferrara's The Secret Still Hidden.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	“Wait,” I said.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	“You are the Pope’s representative in the US, and you are urging me to read a book that questions what the secretary of state wrote?” Sambi replied, “All I am saying is that there are interesting things worth reading in this book.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	And in the end, we are all after the truth, aren’t we?
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	The truth is the important thing...”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	The truth is indeed the important thing.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	And the truth about our situation is revealed in that still-hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010, identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000, which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places:
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	As for the new things which we can find in this message today, there is also the fact that attacks on the Pope and the Church come not only from without, but the sufferings of the Church come precisely from within the Church, from the sin existing within the Church.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	This too is something that we have always known, but today we are seeing it in a really terrifying way: that the greatest persecution of the Church comes not from her enemies without, but arises from sin within the Church, and that the Church thus has a deep need to relearn penance, to accept purification, to learn forgiveness on the one hand, but also the need for justice.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	[emphasis added]
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	I believe that Archbishop Viganò’s precious testimony is a sign that Heaven itself is now responding to the “need for justice” in the Church.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	Whether or not justice involves the resignation of the most wayward Pope in Church history, the inevitable season of justice will culminate in the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Church’s restoration.
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	propaganda	This will be a final victory over the enemies within and their apologists, such as Faggioli, who, in typical neo-Catholic style, imperiously scoffs at the notion of “a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages” and busies himself defending an unsalvageable mass of corruption he dares to describe as “a Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.”
783702663	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic	non-propaganda	I can only conclude by making my own these closing words of Archbishop Viganò:

782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	propaganda	Recently a Muslim spokesman in Tunisia named Said Khecharem, who is affiliated with the international pro-Sharia, pro-caliphate organization Hizb ut-Tahrir, declared (to delighted screams of “Allahu akbar” from his audience), that the “establishment of an Islamic state…requires the conquest of America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy – Rome and other infidel lands will be conquered, Allah willing.”
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	propaganda	According to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), Khecharem also said: “After the laws of Allah were abandoned, and the heretic regimes were imposed on the Muslims, the most important thing to do is to restore the rule of the Muslims, through the Quran and the Sunna, in order to renew Islamic life and to deliver the Islamic message to the world.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	propaganda	My brothers, the implication of this today should be the establishment of an Islamic state over all the lands of the Muslims.”

782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	If Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy “the filthy Jewish entity” and conquer America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy, he would be accused of “Islamophobia” and “bigotry.” But no one will take any particular notice of this.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	They should, however.

782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	The word khalifa means “successor”; the caliph in Sunni Islamic theology is the successor of Muhammad as the military, political, and spiritual leader of the Muslims.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	As I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history, from the immediate post-Muhammad period of the “Rightly Guided Caliphs” to the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, as well as other Islamic states, all waged relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims, subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	propaganda	These weren’t the actions of a “tiny minority of extremists,” abhorred by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims for “hijacking” their religion.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	This was, for fourteen centuries, mainstream, normative Islam, carried forth by the primary authorities in the Islamic world at the time.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	The History of Jihad shows from the accounts of eyewitnesses and contemporary chroniclers through the ages that in every age and in every place where there were Muslims, some of them believed that they had a responsibility given to them by Allah to wage war against and subjugate unbelievers under the rule of Islamic law.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	And so it is today: Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days, but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	What is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	As the jihadis move against non-Muslim states without any letup, pause, period of coexistence, period of tolerance, reformation, or reconsideration, there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	While it is undoubtedly true that not all Muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad, there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	So it is today.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	Islamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations after every jihad terror attack, but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	propaganda	There is still no mosque or Islamic school in the United States that teaches young Muslims why they should reject the understanding of Islam taught by al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other jihad terror groups.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, Said Khecharem and other Islamic spokesmen openly call for Muslims to engage in jihad conquest.
782149225	Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”	non-propaganda	Western authorities should be pondering his words, and their implications, very carefully.

701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	non-propaganda	On September 21, 2017, Zakkout took to Facebook and posted four David Duke videos.
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	Three of the videos were put out by Duke’s official website, DavidDuke.com, one referring to CNN news anchor Wolf Blitzer as a “Jewish Zionist Agent.” The fourth video was a news report featuring a clip of Duke being interviewed at a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia this past August.
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	At this same rally, a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people who were protesting the rally, killing one.

701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	In October 2015, Zakkout posted to Facebook a Duke video, within which Duke makes the wild claim that there has been a “complete takeover of American foreign policy and… American politics by Jewish extremists.” Above the video on Facebook, Zakkout praised Duke, exclaiming “David Duke, a man to believe in!”
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	non-propaganda	In July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring another anti-Semitic Duke video on the AMANA website.
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	The ADL described the video as “venomous.” Currently, AMANA’s official website contains one more Duke video.

701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	non-propaganda	He also pedals much bigotry coming from others, including himself.
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	non-propaganda	In July 2017, Zakkout posted on his Facebook page a four-minute portion of a speech given by Louis Farrakhan at the Nation of Islam’s February 2017 Saviors’ Day.
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	On the video, Farrakhan repeatedly refers to Jews as “Satan.” He states to his audience: “Really, they’re not Jews.

701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	You should learn to call them by their real name, ‘Satan.’ You’re coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.”
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	In June 2016, Zakkout clicked ‘like’ under someone else’s Facebook posting (on Zakkout’s personal Facebook page) of a grotesque cartoon containing a worried-looking religious Jew hiding behind an animated tree with a bearded man brandishing a rifle coming towards them.
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	non-propaganda	The tree is speaking to the man in Arabic, saying “Oh Muslim!

701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	In April 2016, Zakkout promoted a report discussing the absurd notion of Jewish involvement in the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	non-propaganda	A photo from the report shows the burning towers with a Jewish Star affixed to one.
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	non-propaganda	The report begins, “It ain’t debatable!
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	Soup to nuts, top to bottom, the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. were an ‘Israeli’-Jewish job.” The website which published the report and which Zakkout linked to is Mouqawamah Music, a site that openly calls for “Death to Israel” and labels the Jewish religion “wicked and filth-ridden.”
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	In February 2016, Zakkout circulated on social media a report claiming that “the Holocaust was faked.” It begins: “The alleged ‘Holocaust’ of ‘6 million Jews’ at the hands of Adolf Hitler and National Socialist Germany during WWII is the biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity.” It was produced by The Realist Report, an anti-Jew, anti-black, anti-gay independent media outlet, which describes Hitler as “the greatest leader in modern Western history.”
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	non-propaganda	In December 2015, Zakkout posted a photo of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot, who is a decorated veteran of many different wars and battles fought by Israel over the last three-plus decades.
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	propaganda	Above the picture of Eizenkot, Zakkout wrote in Arabic, “You’re a Jew, the grandson of a monkey and a pig.” He signed it “Sofian.” This is one of many times Zakkout has referred to Jews as “monkeys and pigs.”
701225819	South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day	non-propaganda	In July 2014, Zakkout organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami.

729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	GERMANY, February 8, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Cardinal Paul Josef Cordes criticized fellow German Cardinal Reinhard Marx’s suggestion that Catholic priests should consider “blessing” same-sex relationships liturgically.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	Marx’s idea “truly seems sacrilegious” and “ignores the clear Revelation of God,” Cordes wrote in a response on kath.net.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	Dr. Maike Hickson translated it at One Peter Five.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	“The Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church’s Magisterium,” wrote Cordes.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	“Marx does not even mention that homosexuality always contradicts the Will of God,” citing church teaching through the centuries.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	Rather than being about receiving “God’s assistance for themselves,” those engaging in sodomy and wishing to have it “blessed” by the Church “aim with their request at the recognition and acceptance of their homosexual way of life and its ecclesial valorization.”
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that “under no circumstances” can homosexual activity “be approved” as it is “intrinsically disordered.” Such acts are “contrary to the natural law.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	They close the sexual act to the gift of life.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity” (CCC 2357).
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	However, Marx said on February 3 that homosexual couples need “closer pastoral care” and “one must also encourage priests and pastoral workers to give people in concrete situations [of homosexual unions] encouragement.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	I do not really see any problems there.”
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	Marx is the President of the German Bishops’ Conference.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	As LifeSiteNews previously reported, Marx also said “yes,” he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	This “encouragement” from priests which he called for might include some sort of “liturgical” recognition of their union.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	But “how this would be done publicly, in a liturgical form,” is “another question...that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way.”
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	After Catholic News Agency’s initial report on Marx’s comments, his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	The cardinal’s office sent CNA “a request for correction of [its] translation of the interview in question, expressing concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.”
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	The cardinal’s office maintains that rather than saying “yes,” there is a possibility of liturgical “blessing” of gay unions, he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit “yes.” However, the German Bishops’ Conference doesn’t seem to deny the rest of his statements on how “one must encourage priests” to give encouragement to homosexual couples, which could include public blessings that would take a “liturgical” form.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	The cardinal’s staff asked that CNA change his answer about liturgically “blessing” gay unions to: “There are no general solutions and I think that would not be right, because we are talking about pastoral care for individual cases, and that applies to other areas as well, which we cannot regulate, where we have no sets of rules.”
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx’s proposal.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	“Any such ‘blessing rite’ would cooperate in a morally forbidden act, no matter how sincere the persons seeking the blessing,” wrote Chaput.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	He explained such a “blessing” would encourage people to continue living in a way the Church considers gravely sinful and spiritually damaging, and therefore would be uncharitable.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	“There is no love – no charity – without truth, just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth,” he wrote.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	“Creating confusion around important truths of our faith, no matter how positive the intention, only makes a difficult task more difficult.”
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	“There are two principles we need to remember,” Chaput wrote.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	“First, we need to treat all people with the respect and pastoral concern they deserve as children of God with inherent dignity.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	This emphatically includes persons with same-sex attraction.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	Second, there is no truth, no real mercy, and no authentic compassion, in blessing a course of action that leads persons away from God.”
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	“This in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing, but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage, the family, and the dignity of human sexuality,” he explained.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	“Jesus said the truth will make us free.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	propaganda	Nowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable.”
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	Cordes has a history of defending the Church’s moral teaching.
729410793	German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’	non-propaganda	Marx, one of the pope’s nine main advisors, said in 2016 that same-sex relationships have “worth” which must be recognized by the Church.

737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	So far, five states have passed “red flag” laws that allow police agencies to confiscate guns from someone deemed to be “dangerous” by either a law enforcement officer or a family member BEFORE the individual has committed any crime, and in one State (Rhode Island) the governor issued an executive order implementing a “red flag” law.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Here are the six states where the legislatures have already passed—or the governor has already issued an executive order implementing—“red flag” laws:

737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Rhode Island
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	And since Trump’s Stalinist statements, there are at least 24 additional states that are currently considering passing “red flag” laws.

737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Alabama

737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Virginia
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	And it’s not taking long for law enforcement agencies in the above states to begin their Naziesque assault on gun owners.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	This report is from Seattle:Doubtless, many other states are also considering passing “red flag” laws.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“The city’s police department became the first law enforcement agency in the state to force the surrender of a firearm under a new law known as an ‘extreme risk protection order.’
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“The incident involves a man who lives in Belltown, who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year – even staring-down customers through store-front windows with a gun holstered at his side.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“Mental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him.”
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“The man, who we are not naming, is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	The volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order – or ‘erpo’ – which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“In this case, the man refused to comply.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Because of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.”
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“A few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“Law enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings – such as what happened in Parkland, Florida.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“‘There’s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	The “erpos” give us that tool now as an option,’ said Sgt.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Eric Pisconski, who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“The confiscations only last a year, although they can be renewed.”

737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Seattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	A few observations are in order here:
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	First, the open carry of a firearm is LEGAL in the area where this took place.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	So, the fellow was violating NO gun laws whatsoever.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Plus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Secondly, the man was “known” to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	That means nothing.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Known for what?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	The report doesn’t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	It just says he was “known.” And even if he did act weirdly or strangely, if we denied constitutional rights to everyone in that category, a majority of Americans would have no rights, and ALL of Congress would have no rights.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Thirdly, what does “volume of complaints” mean?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	How many complaints were received over a YEAR’S time?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Two?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Five?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Ten?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	People complaining about other people happens all of the time.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Plus, if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act, the man must not have been considered much of a threat.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Fourthly, there was NO report of the man “exhibiting violent behavior,” as the police sergeant claims.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	The report says “he had been intimidating people.” How?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	No specifics except to say he was “staring” at people.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Wow!
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Run for your lives!
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Fifthly, a U.S. citizen who has committed NO CRIME is denied his Natural right of self-defense for a whole year.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	And the media report says the confiscations “only” last a year, with the caveat that they may be extended.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Indeed.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	They could and very likely will be extended indefinitely.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	How many defenseless (unarmed) people are robbed, assaulted, accosted, beaten up, raped, wounded, paralyzed, or killed in a year’s time?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	It seems many politicians (and many police officers themselves) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	I tell you this with all seriousness: At some point, the American people will be forced to view these governmental attacks against our Second Amendment liberties as a declaration of war.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Sixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn’t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him “afraid.”
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	SO WHAT?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	That the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone “afraid” is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and “bear” arms.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	This “I’m offended” or “his gun scares me” complaint is nothing but cover for little Nazis to try and deny another person their Natural, God-given liberty.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	But under this new “red flag” law in Washington State, police are now able to confiscate a person’s firearm without the person committing ANY crime—or even threatening to commit a crime.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Even when police forced the man to surrender his firearm, the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Gun confiscation has started in America—and President Trump’s Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later is the banner under which this is happening.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	When Trump promised to add “mental health” regulations to gun purchases and ownership, he opened Pandora’s Box.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	I go into the “mental health” trap in more detail in this column:
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Trump Set To Enact More Gun Control
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	“Mental health” regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, et al., have been trying to accomplish for decades.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Now, it is the “pro-gun” Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Kris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	He is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	He wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these “red flag” laws:
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	The seizure of guns without any hearing at all.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	The laws all contain an “ex parte” provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person’s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	This is the quintessential denial of due process.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	The Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one’s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	This confiscation is “temporary,” but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Based on the testimony of one unrelated person.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	The confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	The law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a “family member.” [Most of the “red flag” laws, such as the one in Washington State, do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members.]
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	But “family member” is defined to include “former dating partners” and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	So a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Using a very low standard of proof.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	The standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low – one need only show “reasonable cause” to believe that the person may pose a risk.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	That’s even lower than the “probable cause” standard for obtaining a search warrant.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	In addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Within two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	But even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal trials.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Rather, it need only be shown by “a preponderance of evidence” that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	What kind of evidence?
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Things like the “reckless storage” of firearms and drinking habits can be considered.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	If you keep a handgun in the bedside table and drink beer regularly, you may [be] in trouble.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Shifting the burden of proof to the gun owner.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	The long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Once it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	To have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Proving a negative is nearly impossible.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Adding insult to injury, the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	After the Parkland school shooting, had Donald Trump simply used his bully pulpit to promote arming teachers and school employees as a deterrent and defense against these school shootings without calling for more gun control, it would have been a HUGE boost for the Second Amendment in general and school safety in particular.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Instead, Trump fell in with anti-Second Amendment liberals and started calling for more gun control, adding “mental health” restrictions to gun purchases and making his stupid Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	As a result, anti-gun liberals all over the country are using Trump’s own words and proposed gun control policies as a rallying cry to enact gun confiscation laws.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	As it stands right now, Donald Trump has opened the door for more damage being done to the Second Amendment than any other president, Democrat or Republican, in our lifetime.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Freedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next, because, thanks to Donald Trump, gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	And while you are at it, don’t overlook the federal Congress.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	No wonder Dianne Feinstein looked so deliriously (and devilishly) happy when Trump uttered his stupid comment about gun confiscation and said he wanted to bring an assault weapons ban (Feinstein’s bill) into proposed gun control legislation.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	See the video here:
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	Watch Dianne Feinstein Erupt With Glee After Trump Seems To Endorse Her Assault Weapons Ban
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	But if you are a freedom-loving American who values your liberties and the God-given right to defend them, happy is NOT what you should be feeling right now.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	You should be OUTRAGED at Donald Trump, and you should be absolutely determined to be ever vigilant against ANY attempt from Democrats or Republicans from federal, State, or municipal government to enact further restrictions against your right to keep and bear arms—because Trump has opened the door not only for more gun control but also for gun confiscation.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	P.S.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	One more time I want to remind readers that self-defense—including defense against tyrannical government—is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	For anyone, especially a Christian, to willingly surrender their means of self-defense is not only a crime against liberty; it is a sin against God.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	I urge my Christian friends (and anyone else) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled “To Keep or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.”
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Mark it down: Any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their AR-15 rifles would be unconstitutional, unnatural, and unbiblical.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	And NO Christian or other free man should ever comply with such a law.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	I know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that Christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	THEY ARE WRONG.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	They are wrong biblically, constitutionally, and morally.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	Our book shows the Natural and Biblical duty of self-defense.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	I don’t know of another book like it.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	propaganda	With all that is happening today, it is CRUCIAL that people (especially Christians) become familiar with the truths contained in this book.
737194975	Has Trump Opened the Door?	non-propaganda	I urge you to order one for yourself and one (at least) for your friends and kinfolk.

730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	propaganda	WASHINGTON, D.C., February 12, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Those familiar with Jorge Bergoglio in Argentina before he became Pope Francis say it is a “classic” move of his to provide “mercy” to clergy who are sexual predators while asking everybody else to simply “move on,” said attorney and child advocate Elizabeth Yore on an EWTN show last week.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	“I think this is a misplaced mercy.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	propaganda	It is mercy for the predator priests,” she told EWTN’s Raymond Arroyo on the February 8 episode of World Over.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	propaganda	“There are many people who know the Pope from Argentina who have said this is classic Bergoglio to provide mercy to the predators and ask everybody else to move on,” she added.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	(See original The World Over program segment on this issue that begins at 47 seconds into the video below)
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	Yore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	The Pope’s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	propaganda	“The Barros case is putting the Pope, for the first time, in the middle as a principal in a cover-up,” Yore said during the interview.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	Yore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was “told from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.”
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	“The Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	He received petitions and letters and calls, yet, ignored them all,” she said.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	As details continue to surface, the pontiff’s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	propaganda	Yore called the child sex abuse case involving infamous Chilean priest abuser Father Fernando Karadima and Bishop Juan Barros “a scandal of epic proportions.”
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	The scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	Yore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information “extremely dangerous.”
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	propaganda	“But it is extremely dangerous as the head of the Catholic Church — you know, the last appeal — that this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world by bishops, [who will say] ‘Well if the Pope is not going to intervene and impose zero tolerance, why should I?’”
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	Reports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	The alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	non-propaganda	Pope Francis received the victim’s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis’s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced.
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	propaganda	Francis encountered protests in Chile over his defense of Barros during his visit there last month, calling the accusations against the priest “calumny.”
730268758	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert	propaganda	While Francis later apologized, he persisted in defending Barros, denying that he had received any testimony himself and restating that such unproven accusations are “slander.”

706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Traditionalists are often derided by neo-Catholic commentators for relying on supposedly apocryphal quotations from Popes or saints bearing on the current ecclesial crisis.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	But these critics never demonstrate that the oft-cited quotations are apocryphal; they merely assert that they must be, as they seem too probative to be true.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	This is often done in comment boxes or responses to online queries at neo-Catholic websites, wherein the neo-Catholic commentator professes he can find no source for a given quotation—meaning he hasn’t bothered to do any serious investigation beyond a few Google searches.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Take this quotation of Pius XII, for example, speaking in 1931 when he was still Monsignor Pacelli, serving as Pius XI’s Secretary of State:

706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	This persistence of Mary about the dangers which menace the Church is a divine warning against the suicide that would be represented by the alteration of the faith, in her liturgy, her theology and her soul….

706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	When I first cited this quotation some 17 years ago, I was contacted by a very prominent neo-Catholic luminary who demanded a source for it, because he and his friends believed it was “apocryphal.” I did not receive the courtesy of a thank-you when I pointed him to pp.

706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Small wonder: Poulet, who died in 2014 at the age of 94, belonged to the “worker-priest” movement that none other than Pius XII had condemned, as I note here.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	His attempt to debunk the quotation involved nit-picking about what he claimed were factual errors elsewhere in the Roche biography.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	But he had no evidence that the quotation as such was a fabrication.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	He simply wished that it was so.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	Let’s give our neo-Catholic friends another “apocryphal” quotation to dismiss out of hand.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	This one pertains to an astonishing prophecy by Saint Francis of Assisi about a future occupant of the Chair of Peter:
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	A short time before the holy Father’s [St. Francis’] death, he called together his children and warned them of the coming troubles:
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	“Act bravely, my brethren; take courage and trust in the Lord.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	The time is fast approaching in which there will be great trials and afflictions; perplexities and dissensions, both spiritual and temporal, will abound; the charity of many will grow cold, and the malice of the wicked will increase.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	The devils will have unusual power; the immaculate purity of our Order, and of others, will be so much obscured that there will be very few Christians who obey the true Supreme Pontiff and the Roman Church with loyal ears and perfect charity.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	“At the time of this tribulation a man, not canonically elected, will be raised to the Pontificate, who, by his cunning, will endeavour to draw many into error and death.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Then scandals will be multiplied, our Order will be divided, and many others will be entirely destroyed, because they will consent to error instead of opposing it.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	“There will be such diversity of opinions and schisms among the people, the religious and the clergy, that, except those days were shortened, according to the words of the Gospel, even the elect would be led into error, were they not specially guided, amid such great confusion, by the immense mercy of God….
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	“Those who persevere in their fervor and adhere to virtue with love and zeal for the truth, will suffer injuries and persecutions as rebels and schismatics; for their persecutors, urged on by the evil spirits, will say they are rendering a great service to God by destroying such pestilent men from the face of the earth…
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	“Some preachers will keep silent about the truth, and others will trample it under foot and deny it.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Sanctity of life will be held in derision even by those who outwardly profess it, for in those days Our Lord Jesus Christ will send them, not a true Pastor, but a destroyer.” [paragraph breaks added]
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	This quotation appears in Works of the Seraphic Father, St. Francis of Assisi, published in 1882 by the London-based Catholic publishing house R. Washbourne, 1882, pp.

706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	The same book, it must be noted, contains an appendix setting forth “Doubtful Works of Saint Francis,” of which the quotation is not part.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Thus, the publisher itself carefully distinguished the authentic prophecies of Saint Francis from what might be apocryphal.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	Moreover, in 1882 there could hardly have been any “radical traditionalist” motive to circulate phony quotations of the saint.

706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Saint Francis’ prophecy is clearly not a prediction of the Great Western Schism (1378-1417), which did not involve a “destroyer” on the Chair of Peter who leads the faithful into error, widespread apostasy, and the persecution of faithful Catholics as “schismatics.” But it does contain elements very familiar to us today.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	propaganda	And what inference might one draw from the coincidence that Saint Francis’ prophecy of a future “destroyer” in the papal office seems to correspond rather well with the pontificate of the only Pope who has taken Francis’ name as his own?
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Something else to consider: Saint Francis, one of the greatest saints in Church history, one of the few who is known and revered by the whole world, freely revealed his vision of an ecclesial destroyer who usurps the papal office.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	That is, Saint Francis did not suffer from the currently reigning papolatry, which holds that the indefectibility of the Church depends upon defending every word and deed of a given Pope as somehow consistent with Tradition and declares absolutely inadmissible the idea that the holder of the Petrine office could be a threat to the integrity of the Faith.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Rather, Saint Francis, illuminated by heaven itself, recognized the coming reality of what Saint Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church, hypothesized as possible in principle, to cite another “apocryphal” quotation:
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Just as it is licit to resist the Pontiff that aggresses the body, it is also licit to resist the one who aggresses souls or who disturbs civil order, or, above all, who attempts to destroy the Church.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	I say that it is licit to resist by not doing what he orders and by preventing his will from being executed…

706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	That is not for us to judge, although the Church may­ well issue a judgment of Francis like that of the posthumous anathema of Honorius­­ I.
706600938	Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?	non-propaganda	Would Saint Francis have been horrified by the words and deeds of the Pope who has presumed to take his name?

696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The “Jewish Homeland” or “Jewish State” argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration didn’t endorse Israel, but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	That worked so well for the Christians and Jews of the Middle East.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The American Jewish Historical Society is not only co-sponsoring a one-state event by an anti-Israel hate group.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	But it’s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History’s headquarters.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	AJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	And the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	During the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a “JVP Academic Advisory Board Member.” But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The Balfour event was not AJHS’ only partnership with JVP.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	In December, the AJHS will feature “Rubble Rubble”, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel.

696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	His goal is to “normalize Jewish anti-Zionism”.

696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Specifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Leo Forchheimer’s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	What would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	propaganda	A third AJHS-JVP event featured Efrat Yerday, an anti-Israel activist, accusing Israel of racism.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	propaganda	"Efrat has claimed that, ""Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians, but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way, non-white Jews."

696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	AJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	But when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	“Balfour” and “Rubble Rubble” are to be part of AJHS’ “1917: How One Year Changed the World”.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	But the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The exhibition closes with Fishback’s anti-Israel agenda.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	And these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	JVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	It’s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Instead it’s providing a forum for a BDS hate group.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	And it’s no mystery why.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Lila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	"Open Hillel seeks to ""open"" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views."
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Berman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	She signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Other AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	When we look at what is going on in CJH’s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Myers is a symptom of the problem.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	As is AJHS’s partnership with JVP.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	A great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Unlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	propaganda	Its perversion by the radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left to serve anti-Semitic narratives is tragic.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	And yet it’s inescapable.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	propaganda	Even as the Myers scandal continues to simmer, the AJHS partnership with JVP is making the choice painfully clear.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding “moderate” opposing voices into Jewish organizations.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Instead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti-Israel hatred.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	And it will not be satisfied with anything less.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	During the Myers controversy, defenders of his appointment, including some figures named here, claimed that it was an issue of apolitical scholarship.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	propaganda	Is co-sponsoring events with a hate group that has sponsored talks by a woman who accused Jews of drinking blood also apolitical scholarship?
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The anti-Israel leftists at the AJHS are clearly not leaving their politics at home.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	And support for them and for Myers cannot be distinguished from support for their views.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Not when JVP is at AJHS.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	propaganda	We all have choices to make.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Sometimes the choices are murky.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Other times they are simple and easy.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	When the American Jewish Historical Society hosts and co-sponsors an event by a BDS hate group attacking the existence of Israel and featuring a speaker who had defended terrorism and anti-Semitism, the choice becomes easy.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	propaganda	Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	As the anti-Israel radicalism of the left grows, such choices will become even more obscenely simple.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	But they will not be any less difficult.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Opposing the anti-Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	The anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	Speaking out against hate is easiest when it’s weakest.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	It’s hardest when it’s strongest.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	When we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	We don’t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	History tells us why so many people are afraid to do the right thing when it counts.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	It also tells us how irrelevant history makes them.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	There are lessons here for the Center for Jewish History and the American Jewish Historical Society, for those on the inside who see the corruption of their organizations every day and for those on the outside who are worried about speaking up.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	There are lessons here for all of us.
696264594	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event	non-propaganda	If you can’t speak out against the American Jewish Historical Society’s partnership with a hate group linked to a literal blood libels and a speaker who defends Hamas, when will your voice be heard?

999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	The Guardian had to publish an apology.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	The new Guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged Russian malfeasance with Assange and the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Assange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	There is no public evidence that support such claims.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Shortly after the Guardian's fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial:
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	“I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,” the statement said.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	“I have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	I have never reached out to Assange or Wikileaks on any matter.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	We are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false.”
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	At 16:05 utc the Guardian silently edited the story.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Caveats (here in italic and underlined) were added to the headline and within several paragraphs.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	No editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes:
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy, sources say ...
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	It is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	But the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	...
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Why Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	...
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Manafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is “100% false”.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	His lawyers initially declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	One paragraph was added to included Wikileaks' denial:
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	In a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Assange described the story as a hoax.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	At 16:30 utc, under fire from other media and journalists, the Guardian issued a statement:
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	This story relied on a number of sources.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	We put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange's representatives prior to publication.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Neither responded to deny the visits taking place.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	We have since updated the story to reflect their denials.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	This defensive Guardian claim is, like its story, evidently completely false.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Wikileaks publicly denied the Guardian's claims 90 minutes before the story was first published.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Manafort asserts that his lawyers had notified the Guardian that the story was false before the Guardian 'proceeded with the story'.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	At 21:05 utc a third version was published which included Manafort's denial.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Half an hour later Julian Assange instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Wikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	A day after the Guardian smear piece the Washington Times reported that Manafort's passports, entered into evidence by the Mueller prosecution, show that he did not visit London in any of the years the Guardian claimed he was there to visit Assange.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	The story was completely false and the Guardian knew it was.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	It disregarded and left out the denials the subjects of the story had issued before it was published.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	The Guardian has become a main outlet for British government disinformation operations aimed at defaming Russia.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	It smeared Assange and Snowden as Russian collaborators.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	It uncritically peddled the Russiagate story and the nonsensical Skripal claims which are both obviously concocted by British intelligence services.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	That seems to have become its main purpose.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	As Disobediant Media notes (emphasis in the original):
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	While most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian’s smear on its face, the fact that the Guardian published this piece, and that Luke Harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit, tells us something bone-chilling about journalism.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	It is no accident that Luke Harding is still employed: in fact, it is because of Harding’s consistent loyalty to establishment, specifically the UK intelligence apparatus, over the truth that determines his “success” amongst legacy press outlets.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Harding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm, but the personification of it.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Jonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer, makes a similar point:
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	The truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	With this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Its job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: ...
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	The Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	It did what it is designed to do.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	We have previously shown that the Guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	It is openly publishing Goebbels' cartoons and rhetoric against Europes biggest state.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	There is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Unfortunately other 'western' media are not much better.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Within hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	That did not hinder other outlets to add to its smear.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	"Politico allowed ""a former CIA officer,"" writing under a pen name, to suggest - without any evidence - that the Guardian has been duped - not by its MI5/6 and Ecuadorian spy sources, but by Russian disinformation:"
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Rather than being the bombshell smoking gun that directly connects the Trump campaign to WikiLeaks, perhaps the report is something else entirely: a disinformation campaign.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Is it possible someone planted this story as a means to discredit the journalists?
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	...
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	Harding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia’s intelligence operation against the West’s democratic institutions.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	...
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	If this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false—that is, if, for example, the sources lied to Harding and Collyns (or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists), or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake, the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	The is zero evidence in the Politico screed that supports its suggestions and claims.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	It is fake news about a fake news story.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	It also included the false claim that Glenn Greenwald worked with Wikileaks on the Snowden papers.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	That claim was later removed.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	We have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	non-propaganda	When 'western' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	Unfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	The Guardian is only one of many which peddle smears and disinformation about the 'enemies' of the ruling 'western interests'.
999001621	This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted	propaganda	It is on all of us to debunk them and to educate the public about their scheme.

7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	The move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	Like Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed to the belief that Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	In fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	While he was being confirmed as CIA chief, the former lawmaker lashed out at Russia for reasserting ” itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.”
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	Again, if you liked Obama-era, world-on-fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans, this is your guy.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	Pompeo also isn’t a huge fan of calling the federal government out when it is clearly violating the rights of Americans, as shown by his statements last year regarding WikiLeaks.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	“It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence — the GRU — had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	And the report also found that Russia’s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,” he said.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	Pompeo favors increased U.S. involvement in Syria (hello, Russian proxy war), ratcheting pressure on Iran and regime change in North Korea.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	Clinton City…
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	Moving on to Haspel, who will now be heading the CIA, nothing’s looking any brighter.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	She’s a big fan of torture, according to a 2013 Washington Post article pointed out this morning by The Intercept:
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	IN MAY 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake-up” by then-Director John Brennan.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	As Miller documented, this official — whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time — was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush-era torture regime.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	As Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	propaganda	Even more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand” — part of the CIA’s network of “black sites” — “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.
7383612089	Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook	non-propaganda	Bottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren’t going anywhere under Trump.

787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	Using any despicable tactic at hand to derail Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation less than a week before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on whether to approve his nomination, Senate Democrats have sunk to their lowest level of character assassination yet.

787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee that heard Judge Kavanaugh’s public testimony earlier this month during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, had received last July a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge, who we now know was Ms. Ford.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Even though Senator Feinstein had the letter in hand, she never brought up the charge during the public hearing, nor during her own meeting with the judge.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Instead, Senator Feinstein sat on the letter until late last week, when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman’s wish to keep the matter confidential.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Senator Feinstein turned the letter over to the FBI.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	The FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Senator Feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee or to go public with its existence because “the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion” and she had already “taken care of it,” according to a source quoted by The New Yorker.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	Nevertheless, Senator Feinstein evidently bowed to pressure from her leftist colleagues to find a way to insert the allegation into the cesspool of public gossip at the eleventh hour.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	The New Yorker article, written before Ms. Ford publicly identified herself, provided some details regarding her allegation.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	However, now Ms. Ford has decided to do what she called her “civic responsibility” and tell her own story publicly.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	How convenient, coming just 4 days before the scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee vote!
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	The whole sequence of events surrounding how this allegation has suddenly come to light reeks of a set-up, reminiscent of how Anita Hill surfaced in a last-minute attempt to derail Justice Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	Christine Blasey Ford claims, according to the Washington Post article, that “one summer in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend — both ‘stumbling drunk,’ Ford alleges — corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	‘I thought he might inadvertently kill me,’ said Ford.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	‘He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.’” Ms. Ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after “Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.”
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Here is where Ms. Ford’s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Although Ms. Ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, she “said she does not remember some key details of the incident,” according to the Washington Post article.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	For example, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident.” She also does not remember how she got home.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Yet she claims to be absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred, was involved in the alleged incident.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Ms. Ford admitted that she “told no one at the time what had happened to her.” In fact, she said she recalled thinking: “I’m not ever telling anyone this.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	This is nothing, it didn’t happen, and he didn’t rape me.” Even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident, that does not explain why, by her own admission, she “told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,” according to the Washington Post article.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	Most revealingly, the article reported on a gaping hole in the therapist’s notes, portions of which were provided by Ms. Ford for the Washington Post’s review.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	The therapist’s notes “do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students ‘from an elitist boys’ school’ who went on to become ‘highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.’”

787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Judge Kavanaugh has had extensive background checks performed on him in the past for his various federal government positions, including for his current position as a federal appellate court judge, without the accusation ever having surfaced.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	Ms. Ford may believe her story to be true, but the lack of any credible corroborating evidence, her partial memory of details surrounding the alleged incident, and the absence of any pattern of such sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh undercut the reliability of her version of the incident.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	In a letter addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Feinstein, 65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school vouched for his character:

787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Many of us have remained close friends with him and his family over the years.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.

787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	Nevertheless, using their standard contemptible, obstructionist tactics, the Democrats opposed to Judge Kavanaugh happily seized on the unsubstantiated allegation of teen sexual misbehavior in high school to assassinate Judge Kavanaugh’s character.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	They have done so in the face of Judge Kavanaugh’s lifetime record of stellar public service, multiple background checks producing no evidence of sexual misconduct, and the letter written by the 65 women, who knew him when he was in high school and thereafter and who signed their names to a ringing endorsement of his good character.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	Feminists gave the serial sexual predator Bill Clinton a free pass because his policies were in line with their ideology.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	"Senator Feinstein called Ted “Chappaquiddick” Kennedy an ""inspiration and a friend,"" presumably also based on their compatible ideologies."
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	Hypocritically exploiting an unsubstantiated allegation of decades-old purported teenage sexual mischief, Democrats seeking to torpedo Judge Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation for ideological reasons have debased themselves with a shameless smear campaign against an eminently qualified candidate for the Supreme Court.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Predictably, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats, including Senator Feinstein, have called for the Senate to postpone a vote on Judge Kavanaugh.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	"""Senator Grassley must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated,” Senator Schumer said."
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	If a thorough investigation was considered to be so important, why didn't Senator Feinstein set the ball rolling back in July when she first received word of the allegation?
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	propaganda	The answer is that this is all a ruse to block Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation by all means necessary.
787529309	The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	"Senator Schumer is fulfilling his promise to oppose Judge Kavanaugh with ""everything I've got."""

757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	The Islamization of the Public Schools
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Muslims anxious to use schools and textbooks to proselytize for Islam have found a welcoming environment in American public schools that are indefatigably committed to multiculturalism.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	With the imperative to be “tolerant” robbing many educators of their ability to evaluate non-Western cultures critically, all too many public schools and individual teachers have proven to be susceptible to an organized campaign by U.S.-based Islamic organizations and their primary benefactor, Saudi Arabia, to present a view of Islam that whitewashes its violent history and intolerant doctrines.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Many of the Islamic groups that vet American public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on Islamic doctrine and history are Saudi-funded.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	They make sure that the Islamic instruction in these textbooks presents a picture of Islam that is so pristine and whitewashed that it sometimes crosses the boundary from mere pro-Muslim bias into outright Islamic proselytizing.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	The taboo about teaching religion in the public schools, so zealously established and guarded against Christian prayer by the ACLU and the Supreme Court over the last few decades, is increasingly set aside in American public schools, as presentations on Islam frequently cross the line between teaching facts about the religion and teaching the religion as fact.

757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	We have seen this just recently, when Mountain Ridge Middle School in Gerrardstown, West Virginia instructed students to copy out the Islamic profession of faith (shahada), ostensibly as a calligraphy exercise.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Parent Rich Penkoski recounted: “I saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Their excuse was calligraphy.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	I was like, ‘Whoa!
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	Whoa!
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	Whoa!’ First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	I said, ‘That is not happening.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	My daughter is not doing that.’ My daughter told me that if she didn’t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip.”
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Branch contradicted Penkoski, claiming: “The teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents.” He said that Christianity and Judaism were given “equitable treatment” in the same class.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Penkoski’s daughter, Brielle, however, said that the class spent much less time on Christianity and Judaism than it did on Islam.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Penkoski pointed out that the accompanying exercises were also less extensive for Christianity and Judaism than they were for Islam: “Notice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord’s Prayer.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	[There’s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet.”
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	This stealth proselytizing is nationwide.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	Last January, parents filed a federal complaint against Chatham Middle School in Chatham, New Jersey, for forcing students to watch videos that proselytized for Islam.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	One video, according to the complaint, describes “Christians and Jews as ‘infidels’ and prais[es] Muhammad in gruesome detail for slaughtering them.” Parent Libby Hilsenrath characterized the accompanying assignment as “replete with biased, chastising statements encouraging the students…to follow the Quran and become Muslim.” Another video, according to Hilsenrath, depicts a Muslim boy teaching his non-Muslim friend about Islam, after which both go to “learn how to pray.”
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	The complaint adds: “Due to the fact that these doctrinal messages calling for conversion to Islam were included in video format with vivid images and text, they possess greater communicative impact and are more likely to be accepted by the students viewing them than information that is spoken in a classroom or even written in a book.”
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	These accounts are not singular.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	High school students in Newton, Massachusetts in October 2017, according to Fox News, “pretended to be Muslims in the ‘Islamic’ city of Jerusalem as part of a class assignment.” The assignment also included a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel article.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	Judicial Watch Senior Investigator Bill Marshall remarked: “Citizens of Newton have been waging a minor war with school officials for years now, trying to get them to use balanced curriculum in their teaching materials on the subject of Islam and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” Dr. Bill Saxton, chairman of Citizens for National Security, said that the assignment was a “purposeful attempt to indoctrinate our impressionable high-schoolers with the ‘virtues’ of Islam at the expense of Christianity, Judaism and other religions.”
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, Georgia parent Michelle King noted in 2016: “My daughter had to learn the Shahid and the Five Pillars of Islam, which is what you learn to convert,” while not teaching Christianity or the Ten Commandments.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	One homework assignment in Walton County, Georgia, stated: “Allah is the [blank] worshiped by Jews & Christians,” with students having to fill in the blank with “same God.”
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	Parent Steve Alsup added: “It seemed like half the truth to me, they didn’t talk about the extreme Islamics.” Kim Embry, a spokesperson for Walton County Public Schools, said revealingly: “We are teaching the same stuff that everyone else is teaching.”
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Indeed.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	In 2015, students at Spring Hill Middle School in Spring Hill, Tennessee were forced as part of an assignment to write, “There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is his prophet.” Mother Joy Ellis remarked: “This is a seventh grade state standard, and will be on the TCAP.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	I didn’t have a problem with the history of Islam being taught, but to go so far as to make my child write the Shahada, is unacceptable.” Another mother, Brandee Porterfield, observed: “It really did bother me that they skipped the whole chapter on the rise of Christianity and they spent three weeks just studying Islam….I spoke with the teacher and the principal,” she said.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	“They are not going to learn any other religion, doctrines or creeds and they are not going back over this chapter.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Even though they discuss Christianity a little bit during the Middle Ages, they are not ever going to have this basis for Judaism or Christianity later.”
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	Maury County Director of Schools, Chris Marczak, defended the curriculum: “It is our job as a public school system to educate our students on world history in order to be ready to compete in a global society, not to endorse one religion over another or indoctrinate.” Porterfield, however, shot back: “They are not going over anything else.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	propaganda	So for the students to have to memorize this prayer, it does seem like it is indoctrination.”
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	None of the encroachments of Islam in public schools should come as any real surprise.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Multiculturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one’s own.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	The embarrassment, regret, and even self-hatred that has been inculcated in American public school students for decades now has created a vacuum, which Muslims have shown themselves to be all too eager to fill.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Certainly, those who are furthering the Islamization of the schools would deny that they would like to see Islamic law implemented in the United States, and would indignantly reject the claim that their efforts were furthering that end in any way.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	They would say that they are doing it all for tolerance, pluralism, and multiculturalism.
757611486	The Islamization of the Public Schools	non-propaganda	Unfortunately, in the end, it amounts to the same thing.

757713354	Not So Fast	propaganda	How else to describe the decision by Big Brother USA and junior sidekick South Korea to stage major air force exercises on North Korea’s border.
757713354	Not So Fast	propaganda	The prickly North Koreans had a fit, of course, as always when the US flexes its muscles on their borders.
757713354	Not So Fast	propaganda	Continuing South and North Korean peace talks scheduled this week were cancelled by the furious North Koreans.
757713354	Not So Fast	propaganda	The much ballyhooed Singapore summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un is now threatened with cancellation or delay.

757713354	Not So Fast	propaganda	As Trump administration mouthpieces were gabbing about peace and light, the US Air Force was getting ready to fly B-52 heavy bombers and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters around North Korea’s borders and missile-armed subs lurked at sea.

757713354	Not So Fast	propaganda	In a policy one could call ‘eat sand and die,’ Trump demanded that Iran not only give up any and all nuclear capacity (Iran has no nukes), but also junk its non-nuclear armed medium range missiles, stop backing the Palestinians, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, roll over and be good, don’t do anything to upset Israel, and pull out of Syria.

757713354	Not So Fast	non-propaganda	He succeeded in sabotaging the US-North Korea deal.
757713354	Not So Fast	non-propaganda	Why?
757713354	Not So Fast	propaganda	Because Bolton, as an arch neocon, was fanatically pro-Israel and feared that North Korea might provide nuclear technology to Israel’s foes.
757713354	Not So Fast	non-propaganda	As usual with the neocons, Israel’s interests came before those of the United States.
757713354	Not So Fast	non-propaganda	Trump’s newly named Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, is also an ardent neocon.
757713354	Not So Fast	non-propaganda	Last week, Bolton went onto US TV and actually suggested North Korea might follow the course set by Libya, of all places.
757713354	Not So Fast	non-propaganda	Libya’s then ruler, Muammar Kadaffi, bought some nuclear equipment from Pakistan so he could hand it over to the US as a gesture of cooperation after the Bush administration invaded Iraq.

757713354	Not So Fast	non-propaganda	The Northerners certainly seemed to think so.
757713354	Not So Fast	non-propaganda	Some wondered if Bolton and perhaps Pompeo were trying to sabotage the North Korea deal.
757713354	Not So Fast	propaganda	Or were at least being incredibly obtuse and belligerent.
757713354	Not So Fast	propaganda	Was Trump involved in this intrigue?

7709564349	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	non-propaganda	As a result, the judge imposed significantly lesser sentences.
7709564349	Trump Pardons Hammonds!	propaganda	The previous administration, however, filed an overzealous appeal that resulted in the Hammonds being sentenced to five years in prison.

696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Pope Paul VI’s 1965 encyclical on the Eucharist, “Mysterium Fidei,” was the first place I saw anyone say that the body and blood, soul and complete divinity of Christ was actually present in the consecrated species.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Having been raised in Remi de Roo’s Victoria in the 1970s, I had naturally never heard anything at all about the Eucharist.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	The understanding that Catholics believed what they believe about it came as a bit of a shock.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	(Read the full document here. )
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	With the hindsight of 52 years and a great deal of very dirty and unappealing water under the Catholic bridge, we can see it as a kind of warning prophecy.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Published just three months before the close of Vatican II and just as Annibale Bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his never-ending stream of liturgical alterations, Mysterium Fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in Catholic history, perhaps the most important of modern times.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	Who can read this without cringing at what we now know was about to happen:
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Therefore, we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion, so that the Holy Church, under this saving sign of piety, may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all Christians to a unity of faith and of love, drawing them gently, thanks to the action of divine grace.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	But in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the Catholic religion, I knew nothing of any of that.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	The encyclical, the very first I ever read, was also a marker for me of a personal turning point.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It was the first time I had ever seen Catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and – most importantly – unapologetically stated.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It came right out and said something so astounding, something so completely unlikely, that I had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Like C.S.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Lewis’s assessment of the claims by Christ of His own divinity, this pope was either mad, bad or telling the plain truth.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Something that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year I read it, is that the pope’s very first quote was not of scripture, but the Council of Trent:
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	“At the Last Supper, on the night He was handed over, Our Lord instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood, to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He should come, and thus entrust to the Church, His beloved spouse, the memorial of His death and resurrection: a sacrament of devotion, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is received, the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory.”
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	In these words are highlighted both the sacrifice, which pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily, and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood, receiving both grace, the beginning of eternal life, and the medicine of immortality.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	I remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement… “By doing what?
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	!”
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	My acceptance from the reading of this document of the Church’s orthodox eucharistic doctrine was based in part on Pope Paul’s gracious and beautiful exposition, and in part on the sheer radical, mad unlikeliness of it.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	What could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it weren’t true?
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	The idea of transubstantiation struck me as I read that document as possibly the strangest and most earth shattering thing I’d ever heard.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	It shocked me out of a kind of swamp of intellectual worldliness; presenting the idea to my thirsty mind that there could indeed be fantastic realities far more wonderful than the banal and painfully uninteresting secularist worldview I had been taught to accept.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	It was as though someone had plausibly told me that, yes, there were fairies and magical kingdoms in real life, “just around the corner”.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	By the time I read it, I had been through a long, slow transition from a childhood devoted to Our Lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders, to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan Catholic parochial school.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	I had been taught, by both word and implication, that everything the Catholic Church had taught before Vatican II was pernicious nonsense.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	Where it was simply wrong it was ridiculous and where it was wrong and political it was outright wicked.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	What led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It was the first time it occurred to me to investigate, like an anthropologist, what the Church herself said about her teachings.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	While mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the Catholic Church, I was pulled up short by a single thought: “I could be wrong.” At 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think I was rather shocked.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	But stopping a moment to consider, I realised that I had only ever heard about Catholic things from people who clearly hated the Church; her enemies, in short.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	In order to properly and thoroughly condemn the Church, with convincing due diligence, I had to read something about it that didn’t come from her enemies.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	The same day, I presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked, “Do you have any books about Catholicism?
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Something official?” The librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals, documents and histories.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Saints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Having no clear idea what my own question meant, I just picked one at random.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	The description of the Holy Eucharist as the supreme Centre from which all our life as Catholics flow, and from which all other doctrines radiated, was something that was not going to come into my head for another eight years of reading.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	But even so, Mysterium Fidei forced me to face up to a reality I’d never dreamed of before; that this, the little unassuming wafer, was the most important thing in the world.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Reading through the encyclical again, holding it up next to the current situation in Rome, makes it easier to clarify certain critical issues.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Given what we are now seeing, consider the poignancy of the following passages:
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	When dealing with the restoration of the sacred liturgy, the Fathers of the council, by reason of their pastoral concern for the whole Church, considered it of the highest importance to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this Most Holy Mystery, to offer it with the priest to God as a sacrifice for their own salvation and for that of the whole world, and to find in it spiritual nourishment.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	This was, remember, 1965, four years before the New Mass was issued and before Cardinal Ottaviani warned the pope that it was precisely this sacramental reality that was about to be catastrophically obscured.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Who, reading this passage, does not feel the urge to shout down the years, to do something to stave off the disaster that was coming:
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	[W]e are aware of the fact that, among those who deal with this Most Holy Mystery in written or spoken word, there are some who with reference either to Masses which are celebrated in private, or to the dogma of transubstantiation, or to devotion to the Eucharist, spread abroad opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no little confusion about matters of faith.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It is as if everyone were permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the Church, or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Keeping Cardinal Ottaviani’s Intervention directly before our thoughts, we read with a strange kind of helpless dread…
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	…it is not allowable to emphasize what is called the “communal” Mass to the disparagement of Masses celebrated in private, or to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism, which all certainly admit in the Eucharist, expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of Christ’s presence in this sacrament.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	Nor is it allowable to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning what the Council of Trent stated about the marvelous conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood of Christ, speaking rather only of what is called “transignification” and “transfiguration,” or finally to propose and act upon the opinion according to which, in the Consecrated Hosts which remain after the celebration of the sacrifice of the Mass, Christ Our Lord is no longer present.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	[…]
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	And therefore, so that the hope aroused by the council, that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole Church, be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions, we have with apostolic authority decided to address you, venerable brothers, and to express our mind on this subject.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	[1]
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Those of us writing similar jeremiads now have been working to clarify that the attack from Rome on the moral doctrine of the Church isn’t about marriage.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It’s about the Eucharist and to a lesser extent the priesthood.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	The demonic forces we know are the driving force behind this supreme moment of heresy and destruction aren’t really looking at the undermining of marriage as their primary goal; they want to get at the Eucharist.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	We know it is demonically inspired because their hatred is for Christ Himself in the first place and for anyone who loves and wants to serve Him second.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	They are men who refuse to bend the knee before the God whom they will not serve.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	This knowledge – that the attack is on the Body and Blood of Christ – can also help readers spot their friends in the crowd.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	The places where Eucharistic adoration is still offered are places where at least some flicker of the true Faith survives.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	The bishops and priests now talking about the supreme glory of the Eucharist, and the need to defend it from sacrilege, are lighthouses.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	A case in point is Bishop Mark Davies, of my own former diocese of Shrewsbury in England.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	In March, 2016, in the midst of the shouting from Rome, Bishop Davies spoke at his Chrism Mass said that only through the “reality of the Eucharist” could new vocations to the priesthood be found.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	“In treasuring this gift of priestly celibacy we need to recognize more clearly the intimate link between the Ministerial Priesthood and the reality of the Eucharist.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	If the Mass were ever reduced in our minds to being merely a commemorative meal and the priest as only a community leader or functionary, then the celibacy of the Catholic Priesthood might seem extravagant.”
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It’s almost as if someone had slipped a copy of the Ottaviani Intervention inside his morning paper.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	The targeting of marriage, through the instruments of creatures like the myopic and theologically tunnel-visioned Cardinal Kasper, is demonically brilliant.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It’s a “stitch-up” as the English call it; a fix.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	You make it a matter of “mercy” (backed up by the iron fist) that no one in a state of objective mortal sin can be refused Holy Communion; you give the national bishops conferences the power to start enforcing this, and you have created a previously unimaginable situation in the Church.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	You have created a regime in which a refusal to desecrate the sacred species will be grounds for persecution of faithful priests, seminarians and laity.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	And of course, we are seeing it starting already.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It’s a brilliant strategy, the magic bullet that will revert the Church to the 1976 model on every front, and very likely keep it there forever.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	As if the goal was to go back in time and erase the entire John Paul II/Benedict XVI period out of history.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It will halt the revival of eucharistic piety among seminarians; in fact, it will reverse the general reforming trend of “conservative” seminaries that was such a feature under John Paul II and has for 30 years been the hook upon which all hopes of restoration have hung.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	It is easy to see what is coming next.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Once certain announcements are published in parish bulletins, laity will have to consider whether they can, in conscience, continue to assist at Masses where systematic sacrilege has been formally adopted as the rule.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	The few bishops with sufficient spine to stand up to the pressure of both Rome and their own national conferences – newly empowered with directives to make doctrinal declarations – will be ruling embattled islands of Catholicism in a poisoned sea of systematic heresy and desecration.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	A dark, impenetrable and “irreversible” winter of persecution of the faithful by their own shepherds will fall.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	Not being a theologian I have no idea if this encyclical is, as so many of these seemingly orthodox documents of that period seem to be, rife with the usual “time bombs,” ambiguities, mushy language or even outright errors.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	I haven’t looked it up.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	I’m sure there are plenty of people out there qualified to examine it to see if it’s safe for Trad-Catholic consumption.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	And I have no doubt at all that there are better, more venerable, even more sublime and poignant works on the Eucharist in the canon of “official” things.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	From saints and Doctors of the Church and whatnot, many of which the pope cited.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	propaganda	But whatever its flaws, Mysterium Fidei is the one I found, and I’m convinced it wasn’t an accident.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	O God, in Your infinite mercy, forgive and have mercy on Pope Paul VI Montini for whatever neglect or damage of which he may have been guilty.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	In this one case at least, a work of his was the exact right thing at the exact right time.
696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	For me at least it was the key that opened the Door to Narnia.

696694316	Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist	non-propaganda	[1] The fact that four years before the New Mass was issued, Paul VI was pinpointing in such detail exactly what Bugnini and co. were preparing makes it all but impossible to escape the conclusion that he knew perfectly well what was coming but approved the disastrous New Rite anyway.

730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	Now, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	The Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings:
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	For Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service – whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	The blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	Some blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments.

730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	With regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection – sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers.

730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	To bless always means that something shall flourish, because only then when there is a blessing upon a cause or a project, will something good come out of it.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	The blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	[…]
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	But now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	That is to say, one could not consecrate a brothel, one could not bless a concentration camp or weapons which are not explicitly ordained for hunting or for legitimate self-defense.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	Therefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful; [one may not bless] the mafia; no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the Faith, antisemitic contents, or other forms of racist thought.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	If one considers and weighs this matter, one knows: one may not bless a union of two homosexual men or of lesbian women.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	Of course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	This blessing – which is not related to their acts – is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace!
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	This position which is really simple and easily to be understood has been clearly and convincingly presented – since the statement of the two bishops [Marx and Bode] – by several Christians: by Archbishops Ludwig Schick (Germany) and Charles Chaput (USA); by the German-speaking theologians Hubert Windisch and Markus Büning.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	I am sure there are many many others, too, who think alike, but whom I do not know.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	Dear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No!
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	And your addition “in individual cases” is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	What would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod, taking for himself his brother's wife, would have excusingly called himself an “individual case”!
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	The idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly, as follows: “Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.” [Isaiah 5:20]
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	Is this not exactly what Cardinal Marx – and others who are thinking like him – are doing?
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	If one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag “honey,” the cucumbers still remain sour!
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	Even blessing bishops cannot change that.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	Nor can the pope, in calling for a cultural revolution, especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	He says that he “allows himself” to talk like that – but if one dares something, one might win, but one also can perish.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	That seems to catch on these days.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	For example, the Italian moral theologian, Maurizio Chiodi, recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden, but even demanded!
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	To contradict two popes – whom the Church has already “beatified” the one and “canonized” the other – so shortly after their deaths, and in such a radical and open manner, probably has never happened before in the Church's history.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	propaganda	Isaiah says that such people draw unto them God's punishment, with thick cords!
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	Nevertheless, one should wish for Cardinal Marx, Bishop Bode, and Professor Chiodi that they sleep well.
730559808	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions	non-propaganda	Whether their conscience will allow it, is not so certain; but if it does not [allow it], it would certainly be a hope for their conversion.

731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	non-propaganda	Popular at home but increasingly at odds politically and economically with mainstream European Union peers, Orban has thrived on external controversy, including repeated clashes with Brussels and lately the United Nations.
731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	propaganda	Those conflicts, mostly centred on migration since people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa flooded into Europe in 2015, have intensified as the elections approach and Orban poses as a saviour of Europe's Christian nations.
731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	propaganda	"""Christianity is Europe's last hope,"" Orban told an audience of party faithful at the foot of the Royal Castle in Budapest."

731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	propaganda	"The West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun."""
731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	non-propaganda	Orban is widely credited for reversing an economic slump in Hungary and controlling its public finances, culminating in a return to investment-grade for its debt, which was cut to 'junk' during the 2008 global economic crisis.
731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	non-propaganda	To achieve that and hold onto power the prime minister, 54, has used methods that critics have called authoritarian, and picked fights with EU partners, especially in the West.
731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	non-propaganda	Eastern leaders, most notably in Poland, have followed his lead.
731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	non-propaganda	But migration dominates his agenda now.

731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	propaganda	As the West wants eastern Europe to follow its lead, an increasingly vicious struggle was likely, he said, alluding to a plan to redraw the European alliance advocated by the leaders of France and Germany.

731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	non-propaganda	Orban has for years targeted Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose philanthropy aims to bolster liberal and open-border values -- anathema to Orban, an advocate of a loose group of strong nation states that reject multiculturalism.
731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	propaganda	"The Hungarian leader has advocated ""ethnic homogeneity"" and compared Soros, a Jew, to a puppet master unleashing immigration onto Europe to undermine its cultural and economic integrity."

731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	non-propaganda	Orban has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday.
731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	propaganda	Soros, for his part, compared Orban unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930's -- when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany -- and was more oppressive than Cold War Soviet occupation.
731927633	Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections	non-propaganda	Orban has tightened the screws on non-government organisations, particularly ones funded by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university.

7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Outside of specialists and seekers, the only reason why there is general interest in the Qur’an among non-Muslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages Islamic terrorism.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	With What the Qur’an Meant: And Why It Matters, religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us:
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	What did the scripture of Islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels?
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	Some people are sure it is there, though it isn’t.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	Then what does it say about Shari’ah law?
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	Not a thing (p. 7).
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	That would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Unfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite: Wills laments “Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur’an” (p. 58).
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	I have never called for such a ban, and oppose in principle the banning of any book.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Wills, not surprisingly, does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	His manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur’an.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Wills seems determined to put the best possible face on the Qur’an, which requires him to ignore a great deal of Qur’anic incitement and hatred.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	For example, he quotes 5:51 -- “You who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies” (p. 114) -- but he nonetheless concludes, after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain, that “the Qur’an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths” (p. 124).
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Wills never mentions Qur’an 9:29, which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Wills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur’an.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	He renders one key passage in this way: “Fight then until there is no more persecution, and worship [at the shrine] is devoted to God” (2:193; p. 133).
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	Whence the bracketed interpolation “at the shrine”?
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Wills doesn’t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	By adding “at the shrine” to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	He ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	The prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way:
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	The worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr) and Polytheism ( shirk) which constitute rebellion against Allah, The Creator.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	To eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Wills doesn’t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Likewise, when he claims that the Qur’an has “not a thing” to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur’an is one of the sources of Sharia.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	The Qur’an’s declarations that a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who “wage war against Allah and his messenger” are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	Because these stipulations are found in the Qur’an, they cannot be questioned or set aside.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Throughout his book, Wills’ assurances that the Qur’an is not really as bad as “right-wing Islamophobes” say, or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse, dissolve under close scrutiny.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Again and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	He asks why the Qur’an is “so ferocious to ‘hypocrites’ and apostates” (p. 124).
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Then he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that “if we sin again on purpose” there is “only a terrifying judgment to come” (p. 126).
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Wills concludes: “The Qur’an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God’s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness” (p. 126).
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	That sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur’an is more merciful than the New Testament.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Until one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur’an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur’anic passage on this topic:

7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	To “emigrate in the cause of Allah” is to leave one’s home and join up with the Muslims.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	This passage envisions some of the disbelievers becoming Muslim, and then turning away again, whereupon the Muslims are told to “kill them wherever you find them.” God’s inexhaustible mercy, indeed.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Wills’ peaceful fantasy Qur’an raises one massive question that the author does not and cannot answer: if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful and benign as Garry Wills makes it out to be, why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	The Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur’an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book’s core tenets.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	ISIS quoted the Qur’an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain; in explaining its priorities in the nations it is targeting in jihad; in preaching to Christians after collecting the jizya (a Qur’an-based tax, cf.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	Qur’an 9:29); in justifying the execution of accused spies; and in its various videos.

7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	One Malaysian Muslim said that the Qur’an led him to join the Islamic State.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	A Muslima in the U.S. promoted the Islamic State by quoting the Qur’an.

7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	non-propaganda	He had learnt the Quran by heart.” A Muslim politician from Jordan said that the Islamic State’s “doctrine stems from the Qur’an and Sunnah.”
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	How would Garry Wills explain all that?
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	He can’t; he has just explained all Qur’anic violence and intolerance away, leaving the manifest fact that all too many Muslims worldwide think that the Qur’an says exactly what he claims it does not say an unanswered conundrum.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Wills’ naïve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view of the Qur’an, of course, accords with that of his fellow Leftist Catholic, Pope Francis.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	Francis has proclaimedpreposterously that “authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.” Wills’ book accords well with the present-day Catholic Church’s head-in-the-sand posture toward Qur’an-based Islamic jihad violence and the Muslim persecution of the ancient Christian communities of the Middle East.
7646642839	Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: ‘The Religion of the Qur’an Is a Religion of Peace’	propaganda	It isn’t remotely accurate, but it feels good, and for the Catholic and Leftist establishment today, that seems to be all that matters.

758512204	Witness: Muslim Democrat IT Aide Awan Wiretapped Her, Then Bank Account She Controlled Was Drained	propaganda	After former Democratic IT aide Imran Awan allegedly threatened his stepmother not to talk to police, her email account was accessed in suspicious ways and a lawyer for one of Awan’s brothers found out she emailed the FBI on specific dates and lashed out at her: “You’re a liar, aren’t you?” Days after that, a bank account the stepmother controlled was almost completely drained through a payment to Imran’s brother, Abid Awan, bank records show — but she said she is too afraid to press criminal charges because she claims he has threatened her.

700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Last Friday, President Trump made the following announcement:
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	I have decided not to block release of the CIA’s remaining JFK-assassination related records except for those records that directly implicate the CIA in the assassination, which will continue to remain secret.”
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Okay, he didn’t really put it like that.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	But that’s the potential and likely import of his announcement, which actually read as follows:
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” (Italics added.)
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	The operative words, of course, are: “Subject to the receipt of further information….”
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	What is going on here?
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Negotiations.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	The art of the deal.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	The CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long-secret JFK-related records.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	It has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Under long-established custom and tradition in Washington, D.C., when someone asks someone else for a favor, the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	That’s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Trump wants something in return.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	We don’t know what — maybe laying off on the Russia investigation — but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Time to buy old US gold coins
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	What Trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the CIA: “Give me what I want and I’ll give you want you want.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Otherwise, I will let all your cherished long-secret records relating to the JFK assassination be shown to the American people.”
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Make no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	The CIA will cave.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	It will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Trump is in the driver’s seat because the CIA cannot afford to permit the American people to see the records it wants to continue to be kept secret.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	And once the CIA gives Trump what he wants, he will cave and give the CIA the continued secrecy it so desperately needs.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	All this will happen by this Thursday, the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Think about it: The CIA has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or, apparently, some relating to secret correspondence between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board back in the 1990s.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	The CIA’s ground?
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	“National security” of course, the two most important and meaningless words in the American political lexicon.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	National security?
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Really?
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Whatever definition that one might put on that nebulous term, no reasonable person can honestly believe that the release of 50-year-old records are going to result in the United States falling into the ocean or even that the communists are going to take over the federal government.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	The CIA says that releasing its decades-old JFK records will reveal secret “methods” of intelligence gathering.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Really?
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	What, like the CIA was using typewriters instead of computers and pay telephones instead of cell phones?
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	What is amazing (or not) is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media to the CIA’s request for continued secrecy.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	That should be big news.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	It’s essentially an admission of guilt, given that it is absolutely ludicrous to think that “national security” would be threatened by the release of the CIA’s long-secret JFK-assassination-related records.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	You see, the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	In their minds, the assassination was committed by a lone nut former U.S. Marine communist, one who had no motive to kill the president.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Such being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on “national security” grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Let’s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA, in partnership with the military and the Mafia, orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence, either Navy intelligence, the CIA, or the FBI, or a combination of all three.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Don’t forget, after all, that that’s what Oswald said.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	He said he was being framed.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Yet, from the very beginning, the mainstream media has never given any serious consideration to the possibility that Oswald was framed for the crime.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Instead, they have steadfastly stuck with the official story, one that has all the characteristics of a pat frame-up: That Oswald acted alone or possibly acted in concert with others, both of which lead to nothing but dead ends, contradictions, and anomalies.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Now, let’s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	In that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	As part of the frame-up, the CIA would have to fortify the persona of Oswald, its intelligence agent, as a purported communist.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	That would enable the CIA to blame the assassination on a communist, which, not coincidentally, was the advice that the Pentagon and the CIA were doling out to Latin American military dictatorships at the School of the Americas.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	In cases of covert state-sponsored assassinations, Latin American regimes were taught, a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	It would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald’s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	They had to make certain that Oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frame-up.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	The first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald’s bona fides was the DRE, an anti-communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	What no one knew at the time, and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades, was that the DRE was a CIA front organization.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	It was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides, which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s, the House Select Committee in the 1970s, and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	But there was another big operation to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides before the assassination.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	It had to do with Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Something dreadful obviously went wrong with that part of the operation because the official investigation into it was quickly shut down during the early post-assassination period.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Today, Oswald’s Mexico City trip, which is part of those CIA records ready to be released, is still shrouded in mystery.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	The CIA’s continued secrecy in the JFK assassination is no big surprise.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	As I wrote in my October 11 article, “Will Trump Make a Deal with the CIA on JFK Records?,” the CIA is between a rock and a hard place.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	On the one hand, it knows that those records will further implicate the CIA in the Kennedy assassination.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	On the other hand, it knows that by seeking continued secrecy, it’s essentially an implicit acknowledgment of guilt.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Not surprisingly, it is choosing the latter course, especially because it knows that its assets and allies in the mainstream press will continue to come to its defense with respect to its ridiculous claim of “national security.”
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Do the CIA’s long-secret records contain a video-taped confession?
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Of course not.

700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	The CIA’s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state-sponsored assassination into writing.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	But there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Those long-secret records undoubtedly include small bits of important circumstantial evidence that fill out even further the mosaic of a regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, the same types of regime-change operation that took place in Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Cuba in 1960-1963, Congo in 1961, and Chile in 1973, all of which the CIA steadfastly kept secret from the American people.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	In 1953, the CIA was in the process of developing a top-secret manual on assassinations, one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state-sponsored assassinations.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	Every American owes it to himself to read that manual.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	non-propaganda	Too bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves.
700551604	Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?	propaganda	If it did, it might not be so deferential to the deal that Trump and the CIA are about to make to continue the JFK assassination cover-up by continuing to keep some of the CIA’s decades-old JFK’s related assassination records secret from the American people.

728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	On that occasion Archbishop Lefebvre delivered an address on the desperate state of the Church at that time—42 years ago—that was never transcribed or published until we did so for the December 15, 2017 print edition of The Remnant.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It was held at the Radisson South Hotel, Minneapolis, on Tuesday, May 12, 1976, and its stated purpose was to assist the Archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the Society of St. Pius X in the States during the unprecedented crisis Blessed Pope Paul had helped unleash on the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I’m posting the address here because I'm convinced the Archbishop’s words provide recent recruits to Tradition with vital historical context for the diabolical debacle that is the pontificate of Pope Francis.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And for those of us who’ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Even though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	In fact, this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial moment in the history of this movement—Stay in the fight!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Keep the Faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Never surrender!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	This address also makes it absolutely clear that everything Archbishop Lefebvre did was part of an eleventh-hour defence of the Kingship of Christ (ignored completely by the Second Vatican Council) and a desperate last stand for Tradition, the infallible teachings of Mother Church and of course her ancient liturgy.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century’s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	May we continue to earn the right to stand with them today.

728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The Archbishop Speaks
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Ladies and Gentlemen:
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	As I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I can say in bad English what he says in good English, because he said all of the things I want to say [Referring here to Walter Matt’s introductory talk referenced above.]
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And I thank you, Mr. Matt, very much, for his invitation, and I thank you for your coming, and I thank Fr.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Ward for what he said about the Society of St. Pius X.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And I hope that you can understand my poor English, but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	As Mr. Matt said, the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is very difficult to understand the situation today.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	My seminary in Econe (in Switzerland) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America, in Armada, are in very difficult situations with Rome.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Why?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	These seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They have the same discipline and the same studies, they make good priests; I think they are good seminarians.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	All is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Why are we now in this very sad situation with Rome?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I think that because in the Second Vatican Council, and after the Council, there is a mutation, a change, in the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But we do not change.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We continue the Tradition.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	So why do they now say, as Mgr.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	(Archbishop) Benelli[1] said to me months ago on the 19th of March, “you are out of communion with the Church.” I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	This is possible?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I do not understand.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Why?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I have done nothing.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Mgr.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Benelli then said to me, you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council, you accept the reform that followed the Council, and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Mgr.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Benelli took the book of the New Ordo, gave it to me, and said, “You must say this New Mass in all of your houses.”
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I wonder why Mgr.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Benelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	[2] He could have done so.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	For example, one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter (Cardinals Wright, Tabera [Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz, one of the Council Fathers MJM], and Gabriel-Marie Garrone) telling me (in effect) that I must close the seminaries.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Well, I refused, because I refuse to contribute to the destruction of the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Because now they are destroying the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	When I die and go before the judge, God will not be able to say to me, “You destroyed the Church.” I refused to contribute to the destruction of the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I do not destroy the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And so I said to Mgr.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Benelli, “No, I will not sign that writing.”
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I think that the mutation in the Church came in through the Second Vatican Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And do you think this change in the Church came suddenly?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	When, then?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	At the beginning of the Council?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	No, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council].
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Pope Pius VI said during the French Revolution that if the Church continues to remain under the influence of the prince of the revolution, then, in the future a crisis will come upon the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	In [1844], Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	[3] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And what did these Instructions say?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The Instructions said that they [the Carbonari/Freemasons] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year, perhaps not ten years, but perhaps a century.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The Carbonari must enter into the seminary, into the convent, into the sacristy, and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	One day these priests, imbued with Masonic principles, will become bishops, and these bishops can then choose a pope.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And even if the pope is not a Freemason, he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Pope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	In 1895, the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro, a known modernist, founded a masonic lodge in Milan.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	He wrote in his book, Il Santo, that “We [modernists]…want a reform in the Church…without rebellion, carried out by legitimate authority…even if this takes 20, 30, or 50 years.”[4] “The reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.” The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And I think…well, here we are!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	In this time!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The reform is here, and it is brought about through obedience, to the Council, to the bishop, to the priest.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And all they say is “Obedience, obedience, obedience.”
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope, but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [“the banner of revolution”].
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	They said that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	They wrote that!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	One century before [the Council]!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Thus, it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century, perhaps two centuries!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	As the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French-speaking West Africa, I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	There were some seventy cardinals, twenty bishops, and four super-authorities of the religious orders, among others.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Before the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject: one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled “…On Religious Tolerance” and the other, from Cardinal Bea, was titled “On Religious Freedom [Liberty].” When we read these two schemas, we thought, “This is impossible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	How is it we can receive two opposing theses?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	One says we must not tolerate error.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person.” And so, we go into the meeting.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Cardinal Ottaviani, standing, says to Cardinal Bea, “You have no authority to compose this schema, because it is a theological thesis and therefore within the competence of the Theological Commission.” As Cardinal Bea stands up, he says, “I do have the right to compose this schema because if anything concerns Christian Unity it is religious liberty, and I am the President of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity.” Cardinal Bea, addressing Cardinal Ottaviani, further said, “I am opposed to your schema.”
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Impossible!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	We were in a very sad, serious situation.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Cardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals, our brothers.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	He said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But before the Pope came (because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings) we voted on the schema.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Who is with Cardinal Ottaviani?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Who is with Cardinal Bea?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The conservatives and the liberals.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	As the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission, it was for me the first image of the future Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	This historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Isn't it time for you to subscribe?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And as we go into the Council, you know that on the first day of the Council, Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council, [together] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine (such as Cardinal Alfrink, Cardinal Frings, Cardinal Dopfner, Cardinal Suenens, Cardinal Leinart, and Cardinal Koenig of Austria).
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	And now one month ago in Rome, the traditional periodical Chiesa Viva published a photo of Cardinal Lienart with all of the appurtenances of Freemasonry, the date of his inscription in Masonry, the date [of his rising to] the 20th Degree of Freemasonry, the date [of his rising to] the 30th Degree of Freemasonry, and the places where he [attended] the meetings of Freemasonry.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	This Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is my cardinal; he ordained me to the priesthood, and he consecrated me a bishop.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And now this is public.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Nobody has been able to refute the publication.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	And so, we have (I am confident) a mutation in the church by the Council and by the reform after the Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Now, some say the Council is (was) good, but only the reforms were bad.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is not true.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Why?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Because when the reforms come, Rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	In the name of the Council!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	And if the reforms are bad, then it is impossible that the Council is good and all the reforms are bad, because that is the authentic interpretation of the Council by Rome.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Rome said in the name of the Declaration of Liturgy, we [implement] the liturgical reform.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We can say that [these bad changes are] not in the text of the Declaration, but this man has the authority to say that this is from the Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They know that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And I am sure that it [the mutation] is in the Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Even if it is not explicitly [stated] in the Council but [rather] in the spirit of the Council, it is the same!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	For example, with religious freedom: now the Holy See and all the Nuncios are against the Catholic State in the name of the Council - in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I have heard this (personally) twice.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The first time I was in Columbia.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	When I was in Columbia, I read in the paper about the change in the first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Columbia.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	[The first article] stated that only the Republic of Columbia recognizes only the Catholic religion.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They changed it.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They removed this article.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I read the discourse of the President of Columbia with the Nuncios of Columbia and the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference in Columbia.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	The President said he is very, very anxious.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	He said to the people, “even though we remove this article we remain Catholic.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I am a Catholic, I shall remain Catholic, and I do everything possible for the Council and the Catholics in our country.”
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Then, the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason: all of it was “progress,” “humanity,” “evolution,” and all the hubris of a Freemason.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	And during the discourse of the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference, [the Secretary] said, “in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom [of Vatican II], we ask the President to remove this article in the Constitution.”
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I met this Secretary of the Episcopal Conference during my visit in Columbia, and he said for two years they [had been asking] the President, in the name of the Holy See, to change this article in their Constitution.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But I will never…I do not accept the concept, because you destroy the Catholic State in the name of the Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Are you sure?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Yes, sure.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is evident.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Now I said to the [Secretary], “As I speak with you now about Columbia, I know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of Valais in Switzerland one year ago.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The change in the Constitution of Valais was the same.” (Because you know Switzerland is a Federation where some states are Protestant and some states are Catholic.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The Valais is Catholic.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And in its constitution, the words of the first article [of the constitution] of the State of Valais – Econe, where we are located, is in the State of Valais - only one religion is recognized: The Catholic Church.)
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And [the Secretary] said, “Yes, I am responsible for this change.” Brother, what did you do with the Social Kingship of Christ?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	What is this for you?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	What do you say when you say “thy kingdom come” in your prayer, the Our Father?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	“Ah,” the Nuncio said to me, “Now it is impossible.” What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Quas Primas?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	“Ah, but now the Pope cannot write an encyclical like Quas Primas.”
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is incredible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	And all in the name of the Council.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	We must take care, because this change in the church is a liberal change.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	The liberal principles have entered the Church now, and they destroy the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	If we cannot set out the true principles of the Church, if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world…
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	[missing audio...]
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The truth is the only one King of the World is Jesus Christ.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, “Tu solus Altissimus,” “Tu solus Dominus,” “You alone are the Highest,” “You alone are the Lord.” But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We cannot say that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Impossible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We know that in many states (it is a pity) it is impossible [to recognize Catholicism as the state religion].
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	We must tolerate - have tolerance for the error - but never give the same right to error and truth.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	That is impossible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And the change in the liturgy is very important.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is very bad.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	One of the principles of modern man, as they say now, “modern man,” is democracy.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And democracy can have a good sense but not if [by that term is meant] that those who govern receive their authority from the people.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	The authority comes from God.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Not from the people.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Not from the masses.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	From God.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	But today the principle, the democratic principle, is that the authority is in the people.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	It is in the masses.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is not true.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is impossible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And our liturgy is the school of our Faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is the first school of our Faith for all people.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I was in Africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I know the liturgy was the best school of the Faith for people who cannot read.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They can see what the priest does.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They know that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is very important.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	But the change in the Mass destroys the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Because we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The true liturgy is hierarchical.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	It is not democratic but hierarchical.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Why?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Because we have God, the priest, and then the people.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is hierarchy.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	When we are in Church we know God is on the altar; the priest is between God and the people; and the people receive God at the hand of the priest.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	That is hierarchy.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But now the new liturgy is more democratic - all around the table.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The priest is only the president, and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is a new liturgy.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is very bad, because we have no sense of the hierarchical; whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We need the authority of God.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We need the Real Presence of God on our altar.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We need the Sacrifice of the Mass – not a meal only – but the Sacrifice.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	So, the Victim of the Sacrifice is really present on our altar.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is the school of our Faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And slowly, slowly, this new Mass equivocates.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It moves the minds of the faithful in a Protestant [direction].
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I do not say that all [Novus Ordo] Masses are invalid.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I do not say that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But perhaps, more and more, they become invalid because [the ministers lose faith in the Real Presence].
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Recently, in France, a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the Real Presence.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	They found that twenty-two percent no longer have the faith, the belief in the Real Presence.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But I think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age, they would find that fifty percent [have lost the faith in the Real Presence], because the young priests have no faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	No faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Last year, Bishop Adam (in our Diocese of Sion, Switzerland) ordained one priest for my Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	This one priest came from France.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	His uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The uncle had nine children.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The Bishop said to the new priest, “Now you can say Mass for your uncle.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Now you are a priest, and you can say Mass for your uncle.” The new priest said, “No, never.” Why?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is not useful to say Mass for the dead?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	“No, no, it is impossible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They are already in heaven.” This young priest who was ordained by the Bishop last year for my Congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in Switzerland.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They are not learning theology, not philosophy, not anything.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	They learn nothing now.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Another example.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Recently, I had two young [potential] seminarians come to my house near Paris.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	One of them works in a factory, and the other is a university student.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They told me they were [considering] the seminary of Paris.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I asked them, “Why do you come to see me?” They told me that they had a meeting in the house of the Oblate of Maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the Diocese of Paris.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	There was a total of fifteen young men for all of the Diocese of Paris.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	During the meeting, the priest, before he celebrated the Eucharist, said, “Today we celebrate the Eucharist, but we do not believe in the Real Presence.” These two young men said “That is impossible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We cannot remain in this seminary.” So, they came to meet me.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They said that Econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the True Faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They asked for admittance to Econe.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And I think that they shall be coming to Econe next October.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But that is a new religion.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is a Protestant religion.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	That is a fact.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Perhaps you can say, “How is it possible that the pope gives the authorization to this change?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	How is it possible the pope signed this decree?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Signed this constitution?” I don’t know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I don’t know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is a big mystery.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	A big mystery.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	There are many proposed theological answers.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I cannot subscribe to all of them.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Some say the pope is not responsible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Perhaps someone gave the pope an injection, a drug, and he is not responsible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Perhaps, I don’t know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Some say there are two popes [(a body double)].
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I don’t know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Some say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope, and perhaps (we do not know) he gave his name to Freemasonry (thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave).
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We do not know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	We do know now that Bugnini was primarily responsible for the change in liturgy, and that he is an infamous Freemason.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And because he had an indiscretion with his Masonic appurtenances, the Pope sent him as a Nuncio in Iran.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I don’t know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	We don’t know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Now, you cannot say that Archbishop Lefebvre said the pope gave his name to Freemasonry.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	No, you cannot say that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	It is possible, but we do not know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But if he was excommunicated, then he is not pope.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Not pope.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Illegitimate.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I don’t know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is a mystery I cannot understand.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But the fact is that the Catholic Church is being destroyed, and now even the pope himself says that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	This pope has referred to the auto-demolition of the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	He said, “The smoke of Satan has entered the Church.” But where are the men responsible for the destruction of the Church?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Well, there they are.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They are the men who destroy the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We must show where they are.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Where is this smoke of Satan that has entered the Church?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I do not know, but it is the pope himself who said that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And I have these experiences every day.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I visit many countries.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I was in Spain during the Christmas Holy Days.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Then I was in Bonn, near Cologne, Germany, three weeks ago, to speak at a conference.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Many people came.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Many people are confused.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	What is happening in the Church?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They are anxious.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But many people say that we disobey.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Disobey?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Obedience is relative.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is not absolute.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is relative to the good, but not to the evil.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We cannot obey our parents if they command a bad thing.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We cannot obey.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is clear.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And I know that in Spain, for example, the situation in the Church is very bad.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	The new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are, approximately, communist, Marxist, and socialist.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And so, a majority of the bishops in the Episcopal Conference of Spain are progressives.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They are modernists.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Whereas, the majority of the bishops [from Spain] during the Council were conservative.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	So, Rome is responsible [for the situation of the Church in Spain] because it is Rome who approves the nominations for bishops.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And we know in France, in Germany, and in Europe generally, that all of the young bishops are worse [than the bishops in Spain] in that they are more or less Marxist.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is a fact.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is impossible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	How can they do that?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I do not know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I do not know.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I have not spent my whole life in Rome.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I do know Rome very well, because I was an apostolic delegate, and I was in the Secretariate of the Secretary of State.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And I know that very well.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	But I think that the devil is in Rome, as was said by our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of La Salette.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We must pray.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We must ask God to put an end to this crisis of the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Because if this crisis continues, many people will go to hell.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They lose the faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They cannot go into the church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They abandon the faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	You know that many priests have abandoned the faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Many priests have gotten married.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And many sisters have abandoned their congregations.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is a pity.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And it is everywhere.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I was in Melbourne, Australia, during the 40th International Eucharistic Congress.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Cardinal Knox, who was the man responsible for the Eucharistic Congress, is now the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I read in the newspaper about a Mass Cardinal Knox celebrated during the Eucharistic Congress where sensual dancing was performed at the same time the words of the Consecration were pronounced.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	That is a sacrilege.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	You cannot go to that Mass.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	That is sacrilege.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	This is a fact.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They also called me by phone in Melbourne to say I was on the list of the bishops [attending] the Eucharistic Congress.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They asked me to concelebrate Mass with a Protestant pastor and a rabbi.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Ay.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Impossible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Impossible.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	No, no, no, no.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	[applause]
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	This change is not accidental.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is not superficial.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is very deep.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Very bad.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is against our faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Against our faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And so, we cannot accept this Council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from Rome.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	From Rome we expect only the good.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We do not expect the bad, the ill. We do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the Mass.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We need this adoration.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We need to have the faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Because all [of this change] is [oriented] against the divinity of Jesus Christ, against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Mass.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is a sin when we abandon the truth of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, everywhere, and we abandon the Faith of the divinity of Jesus Christ.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	He is King because he is God.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	He is the Son of God.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	So, He is King by His nature.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	This is essential.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Essential!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	And if He is God, we must give Him the adoration of God.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And so, we cannot accept the diminution of this Truth.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Jesus Christ is God.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is a fundamental truth of our Faith.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And it all depends on this Truth.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And we know now that the theologians and the bishops have [a new orientation].
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They do not express this truth clearly and perfectly.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They are afraid of the truth.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	That is very bad.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And it is the same in Rome.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I think they refuse [to grant me an audience with] the pope, [because they are afraid of the Truth].
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	When I was in Rome one month ago, Mgr.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Benelli told me he visits the pope every day.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	He said that when he left me, he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Immediately, he said, he would be going.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	So, why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Because they are afraid.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Meanwhile the Vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Here, again, is Blessed Paul VI, famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Peter's:
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Cardinal Villot said, “We are afraid if Msgr.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	Lefebvre meets and speaks with the pope that perhaps the pope will change his mind.” Because [the pope] is not too sure; the pope is not man of true conviction.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	He is a mysterious man.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We cannot give a definition of the man.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	He expresses the truth, and then he does the contrary/opposite.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Some part of him will speak the truth.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Another part of him is open to error.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Very curious.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And they are afraid that if I reveal the truth [and tell the Pope] “you must affirm the Kingdom of Jesus Christ everywhere and always each day.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	You must affirm the Real Presence in the Mass - in the Sacrifice of the Mass,” then perhaps it is possible that the Pope will change his mind.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And so, Cardinal Villot says, there is a confusion, and they do not want me to visit the pope.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	It is impossible to admit me.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And I know the pope very well!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	When I was the apostolic delegate to Pius XII, I was going to Rome every year.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And during those eleven years, I met Msgr.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Montini.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	I know him very well.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	He received me twice during the Council, for a private audience with the pope.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But, now, with my position against the Council and the reforms, he says: “No, impossible!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	You must sign in writing that you [accept] the Council and all the reforms before I will receive you in audience.” But I cannot do that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	For me, if I do that, then I betray my mother, the Church.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	propaganda	The Church!
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	So, I thank you very much for your encouragement, and I must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	For the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe, Switzerland – applications from the United States, from England, from Germany, from France, and Spain.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Good young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And why?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	Why do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with Rome?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They know that.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But still they come.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I ask them, why do you come to Econe?
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	You know our situation.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They say, “Yes, we know your situation, but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true Sacrifice of the Mass.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And so, we are Coming to Econe.”
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	And as I have visited my seminary here in Armada for the past five days, I can see it is the same here.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	We have very good young men.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	I also have some Americans in my seminary in Econe.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	In six weeks I will ordain one American priest from Detroit, who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	But these young men refuse to become protestants.
728972961	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976	non-propaganda	They refuse to become modernist.

738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Recently an editor of a “conservative” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	I declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	It’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	The consequences of that act have been so outlandish – even for people who are mostly OK with Francis – that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Editor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Dario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	In no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that “there is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.” Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Our thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	MJM
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	In fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope – a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the “filth” in the Curia and throughout the church – suddenly just decide to quit?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Why would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	At the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	These absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	We cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Could we have been wrong about him?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	And if so, could we have been this wrong?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	For reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, “I’m tired.” There was some implication that he didn’t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn’t make it to World Youth Day and similar events.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	The trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Of all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	And since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	This man whom we had believed a “champion of orthodoxy,” whom we thought we knew.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Error, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	How content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	After three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: “Your goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.” Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn’t lie:
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	So strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	But this is not what we see.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	There he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Why, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	If it is a deception, why participate in it?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	In fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Some insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	But we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	And indeed, far from being an isolated “prisoner of the Vatican,” Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	There’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	All the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Why did you resign?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Ratzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	If you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Ratzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Why do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Ratzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	And where did this “emeritus” business come from?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Does it have any precedent in Catholic history?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	What does it mean canonically and doctrinally?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Ratzinger: “…”
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	What was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided “munus” – with an active member and a “contemplative member”?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Doesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Ratzinger: “…”
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	And perhaps most agonising of all: “How can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?”
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	A few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Steve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Five years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	And through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	You may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	He walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	And still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Who is the real Joseph Ratzinger?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	I have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	I think we made the mistake of believing the press.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	We were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	We failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	What the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a “progressive,” as the term was understood in 1962.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	This reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Frings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	After this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	This was done, over Ottaviani’s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French “progressives” who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	It has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger – the maverick “progressive” academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary – who wrote that speech.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Cardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Frings, Archbishop of Cologne.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Blind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Now then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Despite a reply by Card.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Ottaviani, Frings sustained his critique.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	“Card.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Seper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Ratzinger, who did not change, continues it.”
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Ratzinger’s reputation as a “progressive” is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	It went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	In his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	The duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	This implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Neither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Hence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	It was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	But to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	His was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	How ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had “destroyed” and would gain the media-generated reputation as an “arch-conservative”.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	And it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	With the “arch-conservative” “Rottweiler” Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	What did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism – that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	What did “silencing” by Ratzinger’s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity “priest-theologian,” courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Kung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Can we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Precious few.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	But we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith – academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world – with never a peep of protest from Rome.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Moreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the “arch-conservative” John Paul II and the “Rottweiler” Benedict XVI pontificates.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Why did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Is it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	The “progressive” destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet “arch-conservative”…
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Indeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	He was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Perhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Perhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called “progressive” in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a “champion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy” by 2005.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Is this why he resigned?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Is it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Perhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the “liberal” European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the “Sankt Gallen Mafia” that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Fausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Martini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Apparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	By 2012, this had proved impossible.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Why would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini – the “godfather” of the “liberal wing” of European Catholicism?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	I think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	They were esteemed academic colleagues.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	They were brothers of the episcopate.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	They were members of the club.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Any appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Why wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Why is Walter Kasper a cardinal?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	One of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these “conservative” prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	It beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	When, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Jorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the “ultra-liberal” “wing” of the post-Vatican II Church.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	In an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	The monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	This is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Jansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another “Sankt Gallen” member.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	This was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	But that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn’t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Why was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Kasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	But it’s a simple truth: he’s a heretic.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Everyone knows he’s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	After openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Remember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	But he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Nor was he removed from places of influence.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Far from it.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	In 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	In 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	In 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Then Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	And, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger’s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	As Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Cardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	But since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Excuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Is it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope “Emeritus” Benedict – whatever you want to call yourself – I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Why is he still a bishop?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Why is he still allowed to call himself a “Catholic theologian”?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Why did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Doesn’t anyone else want to know this?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Don’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	Why was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Why a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	What are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	My own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	For fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Why have we so often seen these men – compromised intellectually and morally – elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	The end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	The New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Maike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation – in which each, of the so-called “Sankt Gallen Mafia” prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: “It was characteristic of the church’s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.”
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	When journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being – as his Wikipedia page puts it – “one of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.” And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we’re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	There’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Steve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole “emeritus pope” charade was an error: “I think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn’t have.” In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	By playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Because of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church’s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a “big umbrella” with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal “taste” …that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	This schizophrenia is the model under which “conservatives” have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a “conservative champion of orthodoxy.” And what has this achieved?
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	It created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	And just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	As it had to.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	They, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	And their New Church is the only one left.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	For five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don’t talk about it, there isn’t a problem.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Ottaviani’s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church – and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	We had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	One of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	We were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the “New Springtime of Vatican II,” while we watched these wolves in shepherds’ clothing eating the sheep.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	propaganda	Now we can, at least, finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	For those still wondering, Bergoglio isn’t a shock, he isn’t even a surprise; he’s just the logical end result.
738207834	Et Tu, Benedict?	non-propaganda	This pontificate isn’t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.

790665855	MSM Using Kavanaugh Sex Scandal to Distract You From Real Reason He Shouldn’t Be Confirmed	non-propaganda	According to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches “without individualized suspicion” when the government demonstrates a “special need” that “outweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.”

727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	Haig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	In a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show.

727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	Two law enforcement sources told CNN in October that Paddock, during the massacre, fired incendiary bullets at a 43,000-barrel fuel tank on the grounds of nearby McCarran International Airport in what investigators believe was a failed attempt to cause an explosion.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	propaganda	Haig did not mention the incendiary rounds -- which are meant to ignite what they hit -- in Friday's news conference.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	Victor, his attorney, declined to comment about CNN's questions about the incendiary rounds.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	The complaint does not name Haig's associate.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	The law enforcement sources also said tracer rounds were found in Paddock's hotel room.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	But there was no evidence the tracer rounds were used during the attack, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about such details.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	Authorities have repeatedly said Paddock was the only shooter.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	Friday's charges do not allege that Haig knew of Paddock's intentions to kill in Las Vegas.

727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	Haig, an aerospace engineer and part-time ammunition reseller, said at Friday's news conference that he never saw anything suspicious in his brief interactions with Paddock.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	"Paddock arrived at the seller's home in Mesa ""very well-dressed, very well-groomed, very polite, very respectful,"" Haig said."
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	"""At no time did I see anything suspicious or odd or any kind of a tell, anything that would set off an alarm,"" he said."
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	Haig also said that he received death threats after his name was revealed this week.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	"He stressed that his sale made ""no contribution"" to the killings since Paddock didn't appear to have fired tracer rounds."

727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	• Haig first met Paddock at a subsequent Phoenix gun show, where he was selling ammunition.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	• Paddock took Haig's business card because the seller didn't have the quantity of trace ammunition that he wanted.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	• Paddock later called Haig three times to arrange a sale at Haig's home.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	• In September, Paddock arrived at Haig's home, bought the tracer ammunition and drove away.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	The ammunition, he said, was:
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	• 600 rounds of 7.62mm NATO, M62, tracer ammunition, manufactured by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	• 120 rounds of 5.56mm M196 tracer ammunition, manufactured by the same plant.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	He said the 5.56mm rounds were in their original packaging.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	He did not comment on the 7.62mm rounds' packaging.

727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	Victor said police found his client's name and address on a box that Paddock had -- a box that Haig gave him to carry the tracer rounds he had bought.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	Haig said he learned of the massacre when authorities contacted him at work the next morning.
727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	"""Revulsion,"" Haig said of his reaction."

727634031	Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge	non-propaganda	One person of interest, whom police had named previously, was the killer's girlfriend, Marilou Danley.

762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	The Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday that “the Obama administration skirted key U.S. sanctions to grant Iran access to billions in hard currency despite public assurances the administration was engaged in no such action, according to a new congressional investigation.”
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	And it gets even worse: “The investigation, published Wednesday by the House Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, further discloses secret efforts by top Obama administration officials to assure European countries they would receive a pass from U.S. sanctions if they engaged in business with Iran.”
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	This revelation comes after the news that came to light in February, that, according to Bill Gertz in the Washington Times, “the U.S. government has traced some of the $1.7 billion released to Iran by the Obama administration to Iranian-backed terrorists in the two years since the cash was transferred.”
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	There is a law that applies to this situation.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	U.S. Code 2381 says: “Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.”
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	In a sane political environment, Barack Obama would be tried for treason.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	Barack Hussein Obama has planted seeds that will be bearing bitter fruit for years, and probably decades, to come.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	He is, without any doubt, the worst President in American history.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan?
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Yes, the doughface Presidents made the Civil War inevitable, but worse came later.

762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Nah: his tax cuts and return to “normalcy” got the American economy, and the Twenties, roaring.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	FDR and LBJ gave us the modern welfare state and dependent classes automatically voting Democrat; the full bill on the damage they did hasn’t yet been presented.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Nixon?
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	A crook and an economic Leftist, who betrayed Taiwan for the People’s Republic; his record certainly isn’t good.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Carter?
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	Nothing good can be said about his four years of sanctimony and incompetence.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	But there is one thing Barack Obama has on all competitors: treason.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	He showered hundreds of billions of dollars on the Islamic Republic of Iran.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	There are those who say, “It was their money.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	It belonged to the Iranian government but was frozen and not paid since 1979.” Indeed, and there was a reason for that: not even Jimmy Carter, who made the Islamic Republic of Iran possible, thought that money, which had been paid by the Shah’s government in a canceled arms deal, belonged to the mullahs who overthrew the Shah.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Likewise Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush all thought that the Islamic Republic was not due money that was owed to the Shah.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Only Barack Obama did.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	The definition of treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	The leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran order their people to chant “Death to America” in mosques every Friday, and repeatedly vow that they will ultimately destroy the United States of America and the state of Israel.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	How was giving them billions and helping them skirt sanctions applied by the U.S. government not treason?
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	Other Presidents have been incompetent, corrupt, dishonest, but which has committed treason on a scale to rival the treason of Barack Obama?
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	The Iranians also operate a global network of jihad terror organizations, one of which, Hizballah, is quite active in Mexico now, with the obvious ultimate intention of crossing the border and committing jihad massacres of Americans.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	Obama has given a tremendous boost to these initiatives, as well as to Iran’s nuclear program, with his nuclear deal that has given the Iranians hundreds of billions of dollars and essentially a green light to manufacture nuclear weapons, in exchange for absolutely nothing.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	There is no telling when the worst consequences of Obama’s aid and comfort to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be felt.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	But they likely will be felt in one way or another.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Even as President Trump moves swiftly to restore sanctions and put Iran on notice that its nuclear activity and global adventurism will not be tolerated, those billions cannot be recovered, and the Iranians have already spent a great deal for their jihad cause.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	propaganda	However this catastrophe plays out, there is one man who will suffer no consequences whatsoever: Barack Obama.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	That’s Leftist Privilege.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	It’s good to be a powerful Leftist in Washington nowadays.
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Laws?
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Pah!
762340819	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought	non-propaganda	Laws are for conservatives.

764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	However, the Inspector General left the door open to the possibility that political bias did indeed play a role, as his current investigation in the Russia-Collusion probe of the FBI and the DOJ could reveal new evidence to damn the FBI’s Obama era leadership.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	While the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI’s handling of the Clinton probe, it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI’s political leanings in his Russia report.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	The Washington Post explains:
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	The Justice Department inspector general on Thursday castigated former FBI Director James B. Comey for his actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation and found that other senior bureau officials showed a “willingness to take official action” to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president… Some senior bureau officials, the report found, exhibited a disturbing “willingness to take official action” to hurt Trump’s chances to become president.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	Perhaps the most damaging new revelation in the report is a previously-unreported text message in which Peter Strzok, a key investigator on both the Clinton email case and the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign, assured an FBI lawyer in August 2016 that “we’ll stop” Trump from making it to the White House.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	“[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right?
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Right?
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	!” the lawyer, Lisa Page, wrote to Strzok.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	“No.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	No he won’t.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded…
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	The inspector general concluded that Strzok’s text, along with others disparaging Trump, “is not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.”
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	The messages “potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,” the inspector general wrote…
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Strzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump couldn’t win, and that he wasn’t implying that they would take action to stop his election.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	But it wasn’t just Page and Strzok, there were FIVE other investigators on the Clinton case who expressed overtly political views in support of Clinton and/or against Trump… DURING the investigation.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Page and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	The report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views, faulting them for having brought “discredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI’s handling of the midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.” The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	“The messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,” Horowitz alleged.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	“Ultimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and, indeed, the entire FBI.”
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	The IG also found that the FBI moved slowly on new evidence that could have damned Hillary Clinton, and did so for reasons that make no sense.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	The report took particular aim at FBI officials investigating Clinton’s email server for moving slowly after agents in the New York Field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner that might be relevant to their case.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	By no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned “virtually every fact” it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner’s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	The inspector general derided the bureau’s reasons for not moving more quickly — that agents were waiting for additional information from New York, that they couldn’t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the Russia case — as “unpersuasive,” “illogical,” and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on Clinton.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	The report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	“Under these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,” the report said.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Did you get that?
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	IG Horowitz can’t prove it, but he’s not sure that Strzok wasn’t acting in a politically biased manner when he slow-played the Clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the Russia investigation.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	How in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance?
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	We see this kind of corruption all over the world, why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases?
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	There were 7 of them on the case, and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases!
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Not only that, the team that handled Clinton’s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the Russia investigation!
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Meaning, the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported, was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to Russian corruption.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	This is INSANE.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	Meanwhile, another story just breaking at Fox News provides even more evidence that Peter Strzok is the big bad guy in the FBI mess.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Not only was he slow-playing the Clinton investigation, he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	In a newly released FBI email, we learned that “foreign actors” gained at least some access to Hillary Clinton’s unsecure email system.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Fox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week’s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	The IG, separately, is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	The House committees, which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017, addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton’s email security.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	“Documents provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton’s emails — including at least one email classified ‘Secret,'” the memo says, adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Here’s the email in question:
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Peter Strzok email about Clinton emails by Fox News on Scribd
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	The email came from FBI agent Peter Strzok and it’s the first place we see the question of whether or not Clinton can be found as “grossly negligent,” in the handling of classified intel.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	Remember, Strzok is widely credited as the man who changed FBI Director Comey’s language on the Clinton email investigation from the prosecutable “grossly negligent” to the legally superflous “extremely careless.”
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	At HotAir.com John Sexton explains the importance of this discovery:
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	In the FBI memo, you can already see the genesis of the distinction the FBI would rely on to clear Clinton.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Strzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why Hillary seems to be getting a pass when “Petraeus/Berger/Libby” did not.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	He writes, “We draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party, i.e.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	notwithstanding the server setup, we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media, an agent of a foreign power, a lover, etc.” In other words, Hillary may have been hacked but she didn’t intentionally give anything away.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Of course, the statute itself didn’t make intent a prerequisite.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Herridge reports that the House committee memo once again raises this same issue: “Officials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the Espionage Act by stating Secretary Clinton lacked the requisite ‘intent’ for charges to be filed,” the memo says, before pointing to statements by Comey that indicated a belief that intent was required — which the memo says ignored “meaningful aspects” of the law.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	It really does seem that Strzok, an agent who had a personal pro-Hillary bias, was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	I fully believe IG Horowitz’ findings here.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	I believe that he was unable to prove that there was any political motive to the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email case, and I believe that while the case was obviously mishandled, it could have reached the conclusion it did honorably.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	However, I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he’s concluded his Russia investigation.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	In fact, there are already signs of him doing that in this report.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	non-propaganda	Much of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok’s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case, would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess.
764609985	Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!	propaganda	It’s quite possible that as bad as this report is for Comey, Strzok, Page, and Obama’s FBI leadership… Horowitz’ conclusion in the Russia investigation could prove to be even worse.

727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	propaganda	Douglas Haig, a 55-year-old Honeywell engineer, sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock in September.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	Haig's name was inadvertently revealed this week when unredacted court documents were released to reporters.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	Search warrant records showed that Haig was a person of interest in the investigation of the mass shooting.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	propaganda	As a result, Haig said that he has received death threats and people have pounded on his door to tell him that he deserves to die.

727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	Many of their theories lean heavily on Haig's LinkedIn profile, which says that Haig previously worked for Boeing and Northrop Grumman.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	propaganda	Bonkers conspiracy site Intellihub posted an article this week that pointed to Haig's background in the aerospace industry as a sign of U.S. government involvement in the massacre.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	They noted Haig's LinkedIn page, which says he worked for Boeing in Mesa as a senior liaison engineer in their unmanned helicopter division from 2010 to 2013.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	"""Let’s not forget that it is a fact that helicopters were lurking behind the Mandalay Bay during the attack which were not shown on the radar,"" author Shepard Ambellas writes."

727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	Ambellas and Intellihub claim that the FBI and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are providing cover for the real story behind the massacre, with help from Haig.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	In public statements this week, Haig denied any connection to the massacre and said he merely sold Paddock the rounds.

727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	But Haig is an engineer, and he says he's not a former military officer.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	It should be noted that Haig's rounds were probably not even used in the massacre: Haig sold Paddock tracer ammunition, which emit a flare when fired making them easier to see.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	Had Paddock fired these rounds during the nighttime massacre at the concert, they would have been visible.
727736557	Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter	non-propaganda	Haig's attorney Marc Victor told reporters it was perfectly legal for Haig, a private citizen, to sell Paddock hundreds of rounds of tracer ammunition — the bullets are legal in Arizona.

731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	AUSTRIA, February 16, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – The Diocese of Linz, Austria, invited homosexual couples to participate in the blessing of couples on St. Valentine's Day.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	The move comes in the wake of the recent debate over the German bishops' initiative to bless homosexual couples, as well as the controversy over Bishop Andreas Laun's own criticism of it.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	The diocese’s own media report makes a reference to Amoris Laetitia, as well as to Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent initiative.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	The official diocesan newspaper, KirchenZeitung, announced on February 9 that in two different parishes in the Diocese of Linz homosexual couples were explicitly invited to receive a Church blessing on St. Valentine's Day.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	As is explained in the article:
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	St. Valentine is known as the saint of friendship and of love.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	In many parishes and ecclesial institutions, it is already tradition to offer blessings of couples around the time of his feast day.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	People in homosexual relationships are welcome at the blessing ceremonies in Wels-St. Franziskus [Church] and in the Ursulinenkirche.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	Paul Stütz, the author of the article, explains that the blessing of couples “offers an occasion to express love.”
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	“The blessing expresses that one is welcomed by one's partner and by God.” At the end of his article, he adds a link to another report about Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent 3 February interview showing his openness to the idea of blessings of homosexual couples in individual cases as decided by a pastor.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	propaganda	Stütz also quotes in the article itself Father Franz Harant, “a pastoral worker in the field of marriage and the family” at the Ursulinenkirche in Linz.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	propaganda	Harant himself shows himself a supporter of blessings for homosexual couples, and he makes here an explicit reference to Amoris Laetitia.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	As Stütz reports:
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	We give out that universally available blessing.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	There, we have nothing to forbid,” says Harant.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	propaganda	He sees himself in this in union with Pope Francis who himself says in his magisterial document Amoris Laetitia that “each person, independent of his sexual orientation, is to be respected in his dignity and welcomed with respect.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	As the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net writes, Harant must be quoting here AL 250.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	propaganda	Irmgard Lehner, the pastoral assistant of the Wels-St. Franziskus Church, the other of the two parishes that welcome homosexual couples, appreciates this blessing ritual for Valentine's Day, saying it has “an enormous power.” During the ceremony, couples come forward in church and receive a hand on their foreheads and a sign of the cross.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	“We thus stress the high value of relationships,” explains Lehner.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	As the KirchenZeitung journalist adds: “This offer can be accepted by lovers in all kinds of life situations – also by lesbians and homosexuals.” Lehner, who is herself a theologian, regrets that, so far, no homosexual couple has come for the blessing.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	“Here with us, everybody should feel welcome, just as he or she is.” The pastoral assistant adds that “God is love.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	There are no restrictions.”
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	The Diocesan Working Group on Pastoral Care for Homosexuals (dahop) is rejoicing about such a welcome from a parish.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	The group says that it repeatedly receives requests from homosexual couples who wish to “receive a blessing in the frame of a liturgy.”
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	The KirchenZeitung then quotes a commentary, saying:
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	It would be good if a clear sign of openness and invitation would be made by many more pastoral workers [male and female], in order to give the clear signal that love between two persons with equal rights are wished by God and thus already blessed.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	Moreover, the above-quoted Franz Harant himself is the contact person of this Diocesan Working Group – also called “Rainbow Pastoral.” As can be seen on the website of dahop, the Diocese of Linz offers special liturgical services for homosexuals, called “Queer Church Services” (Queer-Gottesdienste) that take place in Harant's own parish.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	It is not clear whether these church services take place in a form of a Holy Mass.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	Similar blessings for homosexual couples are currently taking place, or are being considered, also in Gemany, some of them on the diocesan level, some of them on an individual level.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	As LifeSiteNews reported in January, the Diocese of Limburg is publicly discussing the establishment of a special liturgical rite for the blessing of homosexuals.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	Publicly presented by Johannes zu Eltz, a high-ranking priest of the diocese, his so-called Frankfurt proposal has the public support of the local bishop, Georg Bätzing.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	Additionally, the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net reports that there are two Catholics priests in two different German dioceses who publicly state now to have given many blessings to homosexual couples.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	Father Christoph Simonsen (Diocese of Aachen) says that he has blessed 50 couples in the last fifteen years; Father Siegfried Modenbach (Archdiocese of Paderborn) has blessed two homosexual couples in the last years.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	He also conducts church services for homosexuals.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	Kath.net subsequently contacted both Dioceses and requested information about these two priests.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	As an answer, they were told that the Diocese intends to talk with the concerned priests, but that this matter needs to be addressed among the German bishops in general, such as in the German Bishops' Conference.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	This moral turmoil in German dioceses has provoked concern and criticism among Catholics.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	Mathias von Gersdorff, German pro-life activist and book author, states on his own blog, the upcoming Spring Assembly of the German Bishops' Conference will become crucial in this matter.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	As he sees it, “the bishops of Germany who will meet next week for the Spring Assembly of the Bishops' Conference find themselves in a complicated situation,” where they will have to show their colors.
731513824	Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia	non-propaganda	They will either be in favor of the Catholic Church's teaching on sexuality and marriage and forbid such blessings, or “essentially accept them,” at least by “saying nothing.”

696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	It should be clear by now that the entire official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people dead and hundreds injured is falling apart.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	From shooter Paddock’s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	In the last 24 hours the Sheriff’s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	Originally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	As it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	propaganda	As part of the constantly changing story, officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began didn’t know a hotel security guard had been shot “until they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,” Lombardo said.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	The security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes.

696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	The new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important:
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	propaganda	What happened during the 6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire, and why weren’t the police rushing to the scene immediately?
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	Why did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	Paddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	Police didn’t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped – which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	Moreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor?
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	Or is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic?
696735702	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”	non-propaganda	According to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high:

701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	While the mainstream media was announcing for the past two weeks that President Trump was going to release the CIA’s long-secret records on the JFK assassination, I took a different position.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	On Monday of this week, I predicted that Trump would make a deal with the CIA that would enable the CIA to continue its cover-up of the JFK assassination.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	(See “I Predict Trump Will Continue the CIA’s JFK Assassination Cover-Up” and “No Smoking Guns in the JFK Records?”)
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	On Thursday, the day of the deadline established by law for releasing the records, Trump granted the CIA’s request for continued secrecy, on grounds of “national security,” more than 50 years after the Kennedy assassination.

701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	A blind man could see what was happening.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Donald “Art of the Deal” Trump was obviously negotiating all week with the CIA, and he was obviously pushing to get what he wanted all the way up to the very last day.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	On Thursday, the deadline established by law for releasing the records, the CIA undoubtedly blinked and Trump presumably got what he wanted in return for granting the CIA request for continued secrecy.

701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Some mainstream media commentators are criticizing the CIA for waiting until the very last day to make its case for continued secrecy.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Displaying their naivete, they demonstrate their lack of understanding about how things work in Washington, D.C. As I indicated in my Monday article, when someone in the federal government needs a favor from someone else, the someone else is going to ask for something in return.

701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	The fact is that the CIA put in its request to Trump for continued secrecy of its JFK records long before yesterday.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	But “Art of the Deal” Trump obviously sat on the request, undoubtedly hoping that he could get what he wanted in return if he just continued holding out and conveying that he was ready to release the records.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Don’t forget: According to Trump’s own tweets, he had already ostensibly decided to deny the CIA’s request for secrecy before the Thursday deadline:
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Trump tweet sent on Saturday, October 21: “Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” Trump tweet sent on Wednesday, October 25: “The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	So interesting!
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Now, it’s theoretically possible that the CIA presented Trump with some earthshattering new information on the Thursday deadline that showed that the United States would fall into the ocean if Americans were finally permitted to see the CIA’s long-secret JFK records.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	But how likely is that?
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Not likely at all!
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Instead, it is a virtual certainly that when Art of the Deal Trump sent out those two tweets, he was sending a message to the CIA as part of the negotiations: Give me what I want or I will release the records.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	In the negotiations, both Trump and the CIA knew that Trump was in the catbird seat.

701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	In the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Contrary to what the mainstream press is asserting, the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a U.S. national-security regime-change operation on November 22, 1963.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	That’s what the mainstream media, forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is, simply cannot bring themselves to confront.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Trump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	As I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	On the one hand, it could refuse to grant Trump what he wanted and let the records be released, which it knew would point to the CIA’s guilt in the assassination.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	On the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw — that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	What did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump’s extending the CIA’s 50-year-plus secrecy?
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	We don’t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Here’s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump’s supposed “collusion” with Russia are about to fizzle out.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	That’s because I believe that the CIA, as part of its deal with Trump, will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	In my opinion, that’s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Notice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Ostensibly, the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to “national security.” Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Not surprisingly, the mainstream media isn’t even questioning that ludicrous notion.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	For more than 50 years, the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	During the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s, the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	There are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Finally, the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	The notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why “national security” would be threatened, after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him, causing Trump to suddenly change his mind, is, well, laughable.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	So, why the April deadline?
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Why not extend the secrecy for another 25 years, which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted?
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Because Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	If Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years, he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Let’s say, hypothetically, that I’m right: that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	To make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain, Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	If the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain, Trump releases the records in April.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	If the CIA squelches the Russia investigations, Trump grants another extension of time in April.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Let’s state the obvious: The CIA records that are still being suppressed have nothing to do with “national security.” They have everything to do with covering up the CIA’s role in the U.S. national-security regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, which succeeded in ousting from power a president who was, in the eyes of the U.S. national-security establishment, engaged in actions The CIA, Terrorism, an...

701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	In other words, unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, who had absolutely no motive to kill President Kennedy, the national security establishment did have motive, a powerful motive, the same motive that motivated the CIA and Pentagon to target other political leaders for regime change or assassination around that time, such as Mohamad Mossadegh, Jacobo Arbenz, Patrice Lumumba (who Kennedy admired), Fidel Castro, and Salvador Allende.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	For a more detailed analysis of motive, read FFF’s ebook JFK’s War with the National Security Establishment: Why Kennedy Was Assassinated by Douglas Horne, who served on the staff of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Immediately upon the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald, the official account was that this was just a lone nut, former U.S. Marine communist who decided, for no apparent reason, to assassinate Kennedy.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	One big problem is the official story, however, requires a suspension of logic and common sense.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	For anyone who has a mindset of conformity and deference to authority, that story makes sense because nothing is questioned or challenged.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	For anyone who has a critical, analytical, independent mindset, the official story is filled with holes.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	For example, how many communist Marines have you ever heard of?
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Why would a genuine communist join the Marines in the first place, especially since the Marines had just recently killed millions of North Korean communists?
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Why would a genuine communist join the Marines knowing that he could be called upon at any moment to go to Korea, Laos, Vietnam, Europe, or elsewhere to kill fellow communists?

701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Don’t make me laugh.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Soon after the Warren Commission was established, Warren called a super-secret meeting of the commission to address information that had come into Warren’s possession.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	That information was that Oswald was actually working for U.S. intelligence.

701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	They needed to frame someone for the crime.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	And what better person to frame than a communist or an intelligence agent who the public would believe was a communist?
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	Part of the scheme, obviously, would be to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	That’s why he was sent to New Orleans, where, contradictorily, he would work for a right-wing business owner, work with a right-wing former FBI agent, and conduct a public protest in favor of Fidel Castro and Cuba.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	It was also why he was sent to Mexico City, where he would be ordered to visit the Cuban and Soviet Embassies, no doubt being told that he was being prepared for an important mission, maybe to enter Cuba to assassinate Castro.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	But no government operation ever goes perfectly.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Things obviously went dreadfully wrong with the Mexico City operation because the investigation into it after the assassination was quickly shut down.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Today, it remains shrouded in mystery.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	And guess what is included in the records that Trump has now agreed to continue suppressing.
701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	non-propaganda	You guessed it!

701837665	The JFK Cover-Up Continues	propaganda	Ever since the assassination, the CIA has argued that the release of any of its JFK records would threaten “national security.” One thing is for sure and undeniable: Despite the release of many of the CIA’s records in the 1990s and yesterday, the United States did not fall into the ocean or fall to the communists.

781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	propaganda	WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a message for Donald Trump: You’re wrong, Mr. President.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	propaganda	Sessions long has been one of Trump’s favorite pinatas, often taking the brunt of the president’s public scorn.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	propaganda	Trump offered this assessment of his hand-picked attorney general recusing himself from the Justice Department’s special counsel probe of Russian election meddling: “What kind of man is this?”
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	propaganda	Trump, in an interview that aired Thursday morning, also blasted Sessions because, he said, the former Alabama senator “never took control of the Justice Department.”
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	propaganda	About seven hours later, the country’s top law enforcement officer fired back.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	non-propaganda	And, by doing so, took on Trump publicly in a way few Republicans in Washington have during his turbulent 19-month-old presidency.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	propaganda	“I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President’s agenda — one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty,” the AG said in a statement.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	non-propaganda	“While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	non-propaganda	I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action,” Sessions added.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	propaganda	“However, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States.”
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	propaganda	That last statement comes amid nearly constant complaints from Trump that Justice Department and FBI investigators are being unfair to the president and his allies.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	non-propaganda	That line of criticism has been picked up by, among others, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who was indicted on federal officials this week on charges of misusing campaign finance funds for personal use.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	non-propaganda	Trump did not directly answer a Fox News interviewer’s question about whether he intends to fire Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the special counsel investigation, after November’s congressional elections.
781577820	Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump	non-propaganda	He also said he only gave the former senator the job because Sessions was a supporter during the 2016 presidential race.

764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz has released his 500 plus-page report, which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State under former President Obama.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Such mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	The report from the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey, together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe, including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Mr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Special FBI agent Peter Stzrok and Lisa Page, an attorney who has since left the FBI, were targeted in this report for their blatantly anti-Trump text messages.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch was also criticized for exercising bad judgment in connection with her infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Mr. Horowitz’s report focused on process and procedures.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	"The inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in January 2017 that “his review will not substitute the OIG's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions."""
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Moreover, this report did not address whether the Department of Justice or FBI abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to obtain a surveillance order against former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page, or the government’s reliance on former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele’s salacious and unverified “dossier” in its FISA court application, which the OIG is investigating separately.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	In analyzing the highly anticipated OIG report’s conclusions, it is clear that either Mr. Horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version, which had been reviewed by upper echelons in both the FBI and Justice Department before its public release, emerged in a disappointingly watered-down form.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	To be sure, the report faulted Comey for deviating from FBI and Justice Department procedures in handling the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State, thereby negatively impacting “the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice.” Comey, according to the OIG report, “engaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice.”
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Starting with Comey’s public announcement on July 5, 2016 criticizing Hillary Clinton and her staff for being “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,” but also announcing that the FBI was “expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,” Comey was taken to task for insubordination and usurping the authority of the attorney general.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	He “upset the well-established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions,” the report said.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Comey’s follow-up letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6, 2016 were similarly criticized.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	The first letter informed Congress that agents were reopening their probe into Clinton’s handling of classified material after discovering her e-mails on the laptop of Andrew Weiner, the husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	This letter was followed on November 6, 2016 by Comey’s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the FBI remained convinced that charges were not appropriate.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Comey acted against the advice of senior Justice Department officials in making these disclosures the way he did.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	The OIG report was highly critical of the FBI’s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late September 2016, rather than waiting another month so close to the election.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	The criticisms of Comey's undisciplined behavior was all well and good, but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Hillary Clinton’s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general’s criticisms of Comey’s handling of the July 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in President Trump’s favor, even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	However, what Comey really did was to give Hillary Clinton a Get Out of Jail Free card.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	The fix was in as early as May 2016, well before the FBI interviews of Hillary Clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses, when Comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Comey’s initial draft statement, which he shared with FBI senior leadership on May 2, criticized Clinton’s handling of classified information as “grossly negligent,” but concluded that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a case based on the facts developed in the investigation.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Indeed, Comey admitted in his book that “we started the Clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the Department of Justice would prosecute.”
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	If putting the cart of exoneration before the horse of investigation were not enough, Comey’s draft statement underwent various language changes over the course of the next two months, including, most importantly, changing the description of Clinton’s handling of classified information from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless.” This change was critical because “gross negligence” is specifically the legal term used in stating the statutory requirement in 18 U.S. Code § 793(f) for a finding of criminal conduct.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Comey’s substitution of a legally meaningless phrase, “extremely careless,” for the “gross negligence” statutory legal standard he had originally used, had the effect of prejudging the facts in Hillary Clinton’s favor.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the edits.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Inspector General Horowitz saw no problem with this pattern of obfuscation regarding the deletion of the legally significant phrase “gross negligence” from Comey’s statement.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Mr. Horowitz relied in part on opinions from prosecutors that there was not enough evidence to charge Clinton with acting in a manner that rose to a level of criminal gross negligence with respect to sending or receiving e-mails determined to contain classified information.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Mr. Horowitz’s report thus concluded, “We did not identify evidence of bias or improper considerations.” This conclusion defies common sense.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Gross negligence is not the same as willful intent, which Comey and his team sought to conflate in exonerating Hillary Clinton before the investigation was concluded.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Clinton was fully aware of what she was doing when she set up the private server arrangement in the first place and knowingly used it to send and receive e-mails involving official government business, which by their very nature would be expected to include classified information.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	It turns out that some of the e-mails were accessed by foreign parties.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Hillary lied repeatedly when she first denied there were any classified e-mails on her system and then described some of the e-mails involved in the investigation as having been classified after the fact.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	As Comey has admitted, several e-mail chains concerned matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received by Clinton.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Coupled with her agents’ destruction of thousands of e-mails that had been subpoenaed by Congress, Hillary’s conduct was criminally reckless at the very least, if not constituting willful intent to commit an act she knew was wrongful.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Yet Mr. Horowitz saw no reason to doubt the sincerity of Comey's explanations for giving Hillary a free pass.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	The failure to at least empanel a grand jury to compel testimony from Hillary Clinton and key witnesses was itself a complete dereliction of duty, which could have only been motivated by a desire to treat Hillary Clinton with kid gloves for improper reasons.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Incredibly, however, Mr. Horowitz’s report “found no persuasive evidence… that the outcome of the investigation would have been different had Clinton been subpoenaed before the grand jury.”
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Mr. Horowitz also did not deem Comey’s possible perjury in his testimony before Congress to be an appropriate subject for criminal referral.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Comey testified that his decision to exonerate Hillary was not made before her interview took place, when for all intents and purposes it was.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Mr. Horowitz simply took Comey’s word for what he had meant.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Inspector General Horowitz again emphasized form and process over substance in finding a “troubling lack of any direct, substantive communication” between Comey and Attorney General Lynch ahead of Comey’s July 5 press conference on Clinton and his October 28 letter to Congress.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Attorney General Lynch’s infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton was discussed in the report, but mostly in the context of how it affected Comey’s decision to go rogue, so to speak, in making his July 5th announcement without prior approval from the Justice Department.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	As to the substance of Ms. Lynch’s decision to meet with Bill Clinton at all before his wife’s FBI interview, all Mr. Horowitz’s report had to say was that it was “an error in judgment.”
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	The OIG report also criticized the conduct of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who had exchanged text messages sharply critical of Mr. Trump before and after the election, for casting “a cloud over the entire FBI investigation.” The report referenced a text message on August 8, 2016, in which Strzok reassured Page that she need not worry about Donald Trump becoming president.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Trump is “not ever going to become president, right?
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Right?
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	!” Page texted Strzok.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	“No.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	No he’s not.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Mr. Horowitz wrote that this exchange was “not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.” The inspector general questioned whether Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia collusion investigation over following up on the Clinton e-mail-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	Ultimately, however, he inexplicably concluded that there was no finding of “documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions” discussed in the OIG report.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Strzok should have been subject to a criminal referral for arguably violating 18 U.S.C.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	§ 595, enacted as part of the original 1939 Hatch Act, prohibiting any public officer or employee, in connection with an activity financed wholly or in part by the United States, from using his or her official authority to interfere with or affect the nomination or election of a candidate for federal office including the president of the United States.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	The punishment for violation is a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	non-propaganda	Instead, Strzok's punishment will most likely be limited to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal.
764518567	FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist	propaganda	In sum, the long-awaited inspector general report on the FBI’s and Justice Department’s handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation is as disappointing as the rigged outcome of the e-mail investigation itself.

787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	“Weighing the Allegations against Brett Kavanaugh,” by David French, National Review, September 16, 2018:
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	They’re serious but not solid.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh — outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford — are substantial and serious.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Here’s the core of her story:
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	“He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Do not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	I went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	propaganda	This isn’t “boys will be boys.” Actions have consequences, and it’s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this — even a long time ago — he has to remain “merely” a judge on the D.C.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Circuit Court of Appeals.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Since Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	At the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Yet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	We don’t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton — or for any other politician who’s accused of misconduct.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Is it more likely than not that the allegation is true?
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Given the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	But the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	propaganda	So far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this #MeToo moment.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Here’s why:
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	First, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Did the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred?
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	With Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Here, there was not.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	According to the Washington Post, “Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.”
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	That’s almost three decades of silence — three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	But even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	They actually contradict her story on a key detail.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	According to the Post, “The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.” Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh’s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	propaganda	Those are important discrepancies, and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now, that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	propaganda	As a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible, in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes, the content of the written notes usually prevails.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	propaganda	Juries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes — after all, the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn’t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	At least the investigation seems somewhat manageable.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	If there were only four boys there, who were the other two?
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Let’s hear from them.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	In fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Yet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party?
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	Would they remember any details at all?
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	propaganda	If someone saw Kavanaugh stumbling drunk at the party, that would obviously bolster Ford’s account.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	If another attendee says, “He was totally sober and with me the whole time,” that helps Kavanaugh.
787668628	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros	non-propaganda	But the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie — for either person….

729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	non-propaganda	Feb 9 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico said on Friday it will receive $16 billion in federal aid under a disaster recovery package signed on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump.
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	non-propaganda	That money includes nearly $7 billion announced on Wednesday and will help the bankrupt U.S. territory recover from September's Hurricane Maria, according to a statement on Friday from Governor Ricardo Rossello and Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's nonvoting member of the U.S. Congress.
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	non-propaganda	Rossello said on Wednesday that Puerto Rico would get $4.9 billion to shore up its near-insolvent Medicaid system and another $2 billion or so under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to repair its destroyed electric grid.
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	non-propaganda	On Friday, Rossello and Gonzalez said the island would receive a total of $11 billion under CDBG, a program run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	non-propaganda	The additional portion would be used to help local businesses and repair and build new homes, they said.
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	non-propaganda	In addition to a slow recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years, Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with a combined $120 billion in bond and pension debt.
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	propaganda	The aid announced on Friday provides just a fraction of the $94.4 billion Rossello has said the island needs to recover from cataclysmic damage to its infrastructure and housing stock, although Puerto Rico is eligible to participate in other programs that could increase the aid to $45 billion, according to Friday's statement.
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	non-propaganda	Congress could also appropriate more money later.
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	non-propaganda	The governor has asked Congress for $46 billion in CDBG funding alone.
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	propaganda	"Home damage in Puerto Rico, where the poverty rate is around 46 percent, was exacerbated by the existence of hundreds of thousands of sub-standard ""informal"" homes, which are typically built by the owners themselves, without permits and often in squatter communities."
729670169	Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid	non-propaganda	"""The work carried out in Washington - together with resident commissioner Jenniffer González - was able to deliver the message of the urgency of an allocation of funds that meets the needs of the Island,"" the governor said in Friday's statement."

697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	propaganda	In yet another astonishing eyewitness report that contradicts the official story surrounding the worst mass shooting in American history, a married couple who were celebrating their 10th anniversary in Las Vegas at the time of the shooting have come forward to reveal that there was an active shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel around the same time that supposed lone gunman Stephen Paddock was found dead.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	During the confessional, a Canadian man by the name of Jeff detailed the fact that he and his wife were in the Bellagio Resort and Casino around 11:20pm on the night of the shooting when panic broke out in the hotels lobby.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	Jeff begins the interview by making clear his belief that there were multiple active shooters targeting different places in Las Vegas on the night of the attack.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	“First of all, I think what needs to be said is that, from my perspective, there were multiple events that occurred around Las Vegas, up and down the Strip that night.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	It wasn’t just centralized around the Mandalay Hotel,” the witness claimed.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	The eyewitness then goes on to directly say that he and his wife were involved in an active shooter situation at a different hotel that authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover-up.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	“My wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating our 10th anniversary and on October 1st we were involved in an incident with an active shooter at the Bellagio.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	There is no mistake in my mind about it,” he continued.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	propaganda	Jeff then describes a scene in which he and his wife were walking through the main lobby when screams and gunfire erupted.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	propaganda	Keep in mind, this is all information that the police and the FBI has hidden from the American people.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	“All of a sudden there was just a crescendo of screams that started behind us in the lobby,” he claimed.
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	“Then I heard somebody yell ‘there’s a shooter!
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	There’s a shooter!’ And then I heard like five or six pops, like unmistakable gunfire, unmistakably.”
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	“That was about 11:20 when we heard the shots and the screams… at that point you could hear and see the screams and see hundreds of people coming towards us.”
697959084	Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre	non-propaganda	Amazingly, as Shepard Ambellas noted, “The man’s claims match up to actual events captured in police audio recordings from the night of the shooting which confirms that between 11:15 and 11:18 p.m. on the night of Oct. 1 there was, in fact, something going on at the Bellagio.”

727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	In a debate, Ross Douthat and Massimo Faggioli discussed Pope Francis’s legacy and its effect on internal Church controversies.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	On Wednesday night, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat and Villanova professor of theology Massimo Faggioli came together for a debate entitled “Francis @ Five: Assessing the Legacy of Pope Francis Five Years after His Election.” As I made my way up to Fordham University, I was excited.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	Having followed Douthat and Faggioli’s ongoing dialogue on Twitter, I knew I was in for a lively, if predictable, conversation.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	In his opening remarks, Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis’s papacy thus far: his impact on the public’s perception of the Church (a success); his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy (a disappointment); and his position on “moral-theological controversies,” specifically, communion for the divorced and remarried (a problem).

727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	Faggioli, meanwhile, outlined a genuinely surprising position.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	Rather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better, Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of “continuity” with past popes, since doing so would assume that “Christianity at some point .

727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	was complete,” which Faggioli does not think is true.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	While I emphatically disagree with this argument, I have to hand it to Faggioli: From the outset, he made clear that he was not planning to debate Douthat on the implications of the Francis papacy.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	Instead, through a combination of rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism, he would completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	During the crux of the debate — the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried — Faggioli raised his most theologically unsettling point.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	To defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion, Faggioli invoked the case of Germany, where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	For Faggioli, the implication is that at least 50 percent of German Catholic children never see their parents receive communion and lose their faith because of it.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	This, he says, is “bad for evangelization,” and in order to keep the pews full, the Church’s role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried, but instead to ask, “What can the Catholic Church do to make the faithful able to receive sacraments?”

727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	This is a lovely suggestion, and one that I’m not entirely unsympathetic to.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	However, the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	Just before invoking the German case, Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	But rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany, reasserting the Church’s position on marriage, and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws, Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society.

727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	It should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	If the Church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity, then what is the point of the Church?
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	Pope Benedict XVI has warned against precisely the kind of “accommodation” Faggioli is calling for, writing that when “the people cannot cope” with God, they “bring him down into their own world,” and insist that “he must be the kind of God that [they need].” In other words, “Man is using God, and, in reality, even if it is not outwardly discernible, he is placing himself above God.” To fully drive the point home, Benedict equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	Unsurprisingly, this progressive interpretation of Catholic doctrine eventually reveals itself to be rank historicism.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	Throughout the debate, Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	Eventually, Douthat drew his argument to its logical conclusion with this question: Were priests throughout history in fact misleading their divorced and remarried parishioners by telling them they could not receive communion?
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	After a few seconds’ pause, Faggioli gave the only answer he could: “There are different responses to the same question in different times.”

727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	Throughout their conversation, both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals, unbeknownst to most of “the flock.”

727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	It strikes me, however, that everybody — Catholic or not — has a dog in this fight, which is about more than communion and canon law.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	At its core, this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	Could we possibly say, for instance, that it’s impossible to judge the presidency of Donald Trump relative to past presidents?
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	Of course not — that would be preposterous, as I’m sure Faggioli would agree.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	To pass moral judgements on papacies, presidencies, or anything else, we must have recourse to truth, and to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	non-propaganda	Whether in the Church or in the academy, we must resist this dangerous historicist impulse.
727869189	Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future	propaganda	If we don’t, we will find ourselves, in the words of Pope Benedict, in “a dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one’s own ego and desires.”

698780559	The Las Vegas Security Guard Credited With Finding Shooter, Mysteriously Vanished Into Thin Air	propaganda	His mere existence appears to have been fabricated by the very authorities who are cramming lies down our throats about this massacre for the sake of political agendas.
698780559	The Las Vegas Security Guard Credited With Finding Shooter, Mysteriously Vanished Into Thin Air	propaganda	There are two conflicting timelines of Campos’s injury, but what the media has so far made clear, is that they want the public to believe Campos was walking down the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino’s 32nd floor hallway, when Stephen Paddock spotted him on a camera he’d allegedly set up in a room service cart, just outside his suite.
698780559	The Las Vegas Security Guard Credited With Finding Shooter, Mysteriously Vanished Into Thin Air	non-propaganda	Once he saw Campos, Paddock reportedly fired nearly 200 rounds through his suite door, wounding Campos in the leg.
698780559	The Las Vegas Security Guard Credited With Finding Shooter, Mysteriously Vanished Into Thin Air	non-propaganda	Moments later (6 minutes actually, according to the newly revised timeline regarding Campos) Paddock allegedly opened fire on a crowd killing more than 50 and injuring nearly 500.

727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	non-propaganda	ROME, February 2, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) —His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur in Switzerland, today added his name to the “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage,” bringing the total number of signatories to eight bishops and one cardinal, LifeSite has confirmed.
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	non-propaganda	Bishop Eleganti’s support of the profession comes just three days after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world’s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	propaganda	“God decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,” Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview.

727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	propaganda	In conversation with LifeSiteNews, Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world’s 5,000 bishops would be “a stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.”
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	non-propaganda	The Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage was issued by three Kazakh Ordinaries, including Bishop Schneider, in early January.
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	non-propaganda	In the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church’s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are divorced and “remarried” may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion.
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	non-propaganda	They presented their profession “before God who will judge us,” in response to certain pastoral norms issued by several bishops’ conferences aimed at implementing chapter 8 of Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation on the family, Amoris Laetitia.
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	propaganda	Some of these norms, Schneider told LifeSiteNews, give “implicit approval” of divorce and of sexual activity outside a valid marriage.
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	propaganda	Such a reading is causing “rampant confusion,” will spread “a plague of divorce” in the Church, and is “alien” to the Church’s entire faith and Tradition, the three bishops said in the profession.
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	propaganda	“This is contrary to Divine Revelation,” Schneider further told LifeSite, adding that the “beautiful explanations” that are being presented to clergy and faithful as “discernment” and “pastoral accompaniment,” or a “change of paradigm” and “discovery of the subjective part of the truth,” when translated into “common sense language,” are tantamount to an allowance to sin.
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	non-propaganda	“Our conscience as bishops calls to us to do this,” Schneider explained.
727658675	Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith	non-propaganda	“We were forced by our conscience, in the conscience of the Successors of the Apostles and colleagues of the Pope.”

789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	From the playground to geopolitics, appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	This timeless truth of human nature is one that we moderns can’t seem to accept.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	We reflexively assume that a rational accommodation or concessions will be reciprocated by those proven to be ready to use any means necessary to achieve their aims, no matter how amoral, unfair, or vicious.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court illustrate that this false assumption leads only to more demands, and ultimately to defeat.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	The last-minute accusations from Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who claims that decades ago Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party, and Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a frat party at Yale, are transparent acts of aggression against the judge and Republicans, one engineered by the Democrats.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Senator Dianne Feinstein sat for months on Ford’s letter and then––just as the Dems did in 1991with Anita Hill’s charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas’s during his hearings––released it only when Kavanaugh appeared to be heading for confirmation.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Feinstein still hasn’t given the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of the letter.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	A few weeks after Ford went public, and after Kavanaugh said he had dairies from that summer detailing his whereabouts, The New Yorker published Ramirez’s account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to Ramirez.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Given that the Democrats had made public in advance their intention to derail the hearings and confirmation by any means possible, the timing of both sexual assault charges reeks of premeditated contrivance intended to delay confirmation as long as possible.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	But in the face of this naked ploy to bork Kavanaugh and derail the confirmation process for partisan advantage, the Republicans seem to be reverting to their customary preemptive cringe.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	All the Dems have to do is squeal “sexism” and Republicans start negotiating and offering concessions.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Of course, after each concession comes another demand.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	First the Dems demanded that Ford, a long-time Democrat activist, “be heard.” So last week the Chairman of Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, granted another deadline extension for Ford to decide whether to testify before the Committee on Monday.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Senator Dianne Feinstein calls these concessions “bullying deadlines.” As Feinstein put it, “Show some heart.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Wait until Dr. Ford feels that she can come before the committee.” Ford doesn’t “feel” like she can testify on Monday because she’s afraid of flying, despite offers from the Committee to travel to her in California.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Then she feared for her life because of death threats ––threats also made to Kavanaugh, his wife and two young daughters–– so she now demands enhanced security measures.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	The Committee caved and moved the date to Thursday.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	So of course, Grassley having been intimidated into giving Ford a chance to address the Committee, Ramirez and her handlers are now demanding the same privilege.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	“Creepy Lawyer” for porn star Stormy Daniels claims to represent a woman who also should be allowed to testify to the Senate Committee about Kavanaugh’s partying habits while at Yale.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	We’ll have to see whether Grassley can find the stomach to put an end to the farce of allowing unsubstantiated charges from Democrat activists to waste the Committee’s time.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Ford and Dianne Feinstein also keep demanding an FBI investigation, even though no federal crime is being alleged, and any investigation 36 years after the offense is impossible.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Ford can’t remember where and when the alleged assault took place, nor how she got to or went home from the party where it allegedly occurred.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Her own details of the event don’t jibe (Four boys or three?
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	One girl or two?).
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	She told no one about the assault until 30 years later.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	A “lifelong friend” whom Ford claims was at the party has denied any knowledge of the it, and says she’s never met Kavanaugh.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Another friend who reported that the school was abuzz with gossip about the attack (which apparently took place during summer break), retracted her statement.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	The two men Ford named as possible witnesses to the assault have contradicter her claims under oath.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	And the accused Judge Kavanaugh also under oath vehemently denies the charges.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Given that 36 years have passed since the incident, and the accuser’s memory is so hazy and short on coherent details, the FBI has nothing to investigate.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Ramirez’s charge is even flimsier.

789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	A woman who claims she was “best friends” with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned the story and initially said her friend's accusations against Kavanaugh might be “politically motivated.”
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	7.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Ramirez, just like Christine Blasey Ford, is a registered Democrat and is dedicated to leftist causes.

789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	No law enforcement agency, let alone the FBI, would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past, and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	The “FBI investigation” is another delaying tactic.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Ford has finally agreed to testify, set for Thursday for now.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	But it’s unclear whether Grassley has granted Ford any of her preposterous conditions for testifying: She will take questions from the Committee, but not from outside lawyers, who might not be as gentle as politicians with one eye on the polls.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Only one camera can be in the room.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Kavanaugh must testify first, a grotesque inversion of our bedrock principle that an accused has the right to confront his accuser’s charges.

789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	They all comprise the old tactic of serially escalating demands that cannot be satisfied in order to compel your enemy to give in.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	That Grassley and the Republicans would even participate in this absurd show trial is testimony to how deeply the progressive ideological narrative has burrowed into our social and political life.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	If Ford actually testifies on Thursday, or Ramirez is granted the same concession, nothing material will be gained.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Her accusation will not be proved true or false.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	We will learn nothing about Kavanaugh that makes him any less eminently qualified for the Supreme Court, nothing that can add to the thousands of pages of documents already presented to the Committee, or the hundreds of hours of the judge’s testimony before rabid partisans and office-seekers.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	But vetting Kavanaugh’s qualifications isn’t the point.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	The point is to delay confirmation by slandering Kavanaugh and baiting the Republicans into appearing to abuse victims of sexual assault.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Why?
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Facing his likely confirmation, the Dems, egged on by the mainstream media––especially The New Yorker, which published a story too badly sourced even for The New York Times–– are desperately attempting to obstruct and delay the process until after the midterm elections, when they hope they will retake the Senate and thus stop any more Constitutionalist judges from being confirmed to the Court for the rest of Trump’s term.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	The Democrats have stooped so low with these smears because they know the stakes.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	The courts and especially the Supreme Court have been critical to the progressives’ program since Woodrow Wilson.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	The biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the Constitution.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Its divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Hence the Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	But if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench, who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress’s law-making powers.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	That’s why this current nomination is a hill the Dems are willing to beclown themselves on.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Given how obviously partisan and hypocritical this ploy is––doesn’t Keith Ellison’s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too?
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	––why has Grassley so far allowed himself to be played by the Dems?
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Because Republicans fear the backlash from all those women voters who presumably agree with the fundamentalist feminists, and insist that every accusation of sexual assault, no matter how much it’s unsupported by corroborating evidence or even plausibility, must be believed.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	This contention itself is an expression of the radical feminist narrative of innate male feral sexuality that makes them sexual predators.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	The irony is that today’s feminists have been willing to sacrifice the earlier narrative of female power and agency that had been stifled by traditional views of the sexes and their capabilities.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Instead, now women are Victorian hothouse flowers too delicate to make their way through their lives without the paternal federal government protecting them with its coercive power.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Women have exchanged one form of dependence, and one double standard for another.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	The Dems are using Ford and Ramirez as part of the Democrats’ transparently dishonest delaying tactics because they know that most Republicans have accepted this duplicitous feminist narrative and fear challenging it.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Especially after the recent spate of sexual assault charges––many of them true, some false, others contested–– politicians consider bucking the narrative to be as politically suicidal as proposing to reform Social Security and Medicare.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	It’s the new third rail of American politics, one that transcends party affiliation.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Hence the widespread virtue-signaling on the part even of conservative writers who preface their comments about Ford and Ramirez with prologues full of truisms about how horrible sexual assault is, how its self-proclaimed victims “must be heard,” and how churlish and sexist it is to question the truth of any charge.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Grown-ups know all that and don’t have to be reminded every time the subject arises.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	The Dems know that most Republicans come to this conflict with the huge disadvantage that results from accepting your opponent’s dubious ideology and dishonest narrative.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	The progressive party can dare the Republicans to ignore the endless specious demands, stop the show-trial, and proceed to a vote on Kavanaugh, because they know the Republicans, fearful of the “optics,” will cave.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	They know that the eleven male Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee dread the #MeToo movement casting them as knuckle-dragging Neanderthal sexists who want to “silence” the accuser with their “cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor,” as one Ford lawyer has said.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Republicans still don’t get that no amount of appeasement will stop the left from demonizing them anyway.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Just ask Boy Scout Mitt Romney, who was savaged for his innocuous “binders full of women.”
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	And don’t forget, the old sorta, kinda moderate Democrats like Feinstein and Chuck Schumer, who now have joined the crowd of trendoid socialists armed with torches and pitch-forks, will go along because they’re frightened of their party’s increasingly rabid left-wing base.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	What can we do to end these confirmation circuses?
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Just stop holding them.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	There’s nothing in the Constitution that says the Senate’s power to give “advice and consent” to the president regarding his nominee must entail days of televised hearings replete with caterwauling protestors and grandstanding Senators who’ve already made-up their minds.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Invite written questions from the Senate, then schedule one day for the nominee to respond.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Don’t put it on television, but make public a written transcript.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Remove the television cameras, and attention-craving, politically ambitious Senators will be gone like a cool breeze.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	For now, Grassley needs to end this farce if Ford doesn’t show up on Thursday or continues to negotiate for more delays and concessions.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	No more concessions.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	No more delays.

789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Hold the vote no later than Thursday, or Friday if Ford does show up.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	non-propaganda	Make Senators go on the record with their votes, and hold them to account in November.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	Put to the test the Dems’ claims that a critical mass of women, many of them with sons they don’t want falsely accused, believes the fundamentalist feminist narrative and will vote accordingly.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	To borrow Churchill’s definition of appeasement, stop feeding the alligator in the hopes that you will be eaten last.
789615291	Stop Appeasing the Democrats	propaganda	For fifty years the Democrats have proven they will demonize conservatives as racist and sexist no matter how often they bow and scrape.

776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	Attorney General Sessions recused himself from overseeing the investigation early in 2017.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	The New York Times hypothesized that this was done, in part, to avoid the kind of conflicts such as that which Trump has proposed.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	Later, a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed to carry out the investigation.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	Trump’s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jay A. Sekulow, said in a telephone interview that the president was not ordering the inquiry closed but simply expressing his opinion via the social media platform.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	“It’s not a call to action,” Mr. Giuliani said, adding that it was a sentiment that Mr. Trump and his lawyers have expressed publicly before.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	“He’s expressing his opinion, but he’s not talking of his special powers he has” as president, Giuliani said.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	“He doesn’t feel that he has to intervene in the process, nor is he intervening,” said Sekulow.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	The special counsel is also looking into some of Trump’s tweets about Attorney General Sessions and the former F.B.I.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	director James Comey and whether the messages were intended to “obstruct the inquiry” into his alleged Russian collusion.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont, suggested on Twitter that the president’s directive to Sessions in these recent Tweets was, in fact, obstruction.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	When I was a prosecutor, obstruction of justice was often hard to prove, requiring difficult-to-obtain evidence that the individual’s actions were truly intended to interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation.
776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	propaganda	Oh how times have changed.

776368676	Trump To Sessions In Series Of Tweets: ‘Stop The Rigged Witch Hunt NOW!’	non-propaganda	Although, according to Guiliani, Mueller suggested that the Russia obstruction probe would be wrapping up by September 1.

782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Still, we’re also averse to speaking in terms of good and evil.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Right and wrong?
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Maybe.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	But good and evil have a supernatural ring we usually reserve for dramatic and abominable crimes, like genocide.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	Yet everything right is good, and everything wrong is evil.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	The evils we encounter in our day-to-day lives might not be a spectacle, like jihadists beheading a journalist on live television.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	All the same, evil is part of ordinary life.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	It dwells deep in our hearts – each and every one of us.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	The Prince of this World has made a grand display of his authority in the last few centuries.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Our saving grace is that, while Westerners no longer believe in God, they still believe in the Devil.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	We’re at least clear-eyed enough to recognize true evil at work in the world, even if we can no longer see the great Good hidden behind the veil.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	This is the point about the McCarrick scandal that even religious commentators tend to overlook.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	How was he allowed to go on molesting young priests and seminarians when virtually the entire Church hierarchy knew what he was up to?
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	And how was such a depraved individual ordained in the first place, let alone promoted to Cardinal-Archbishop of Washington?
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	The answer is, ultimately, demonic.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	As Catholics, we ask St. Michael to “cast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.” McCarrick and his fellow perverts in the clergy are responsible, not only for their sexual abuses, but also for chasing good men away from the priesthood.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	Spend enough time in Catholic World and you inevitably meet good men who quit the seminary because of some rampant (and often violent) depravity.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	What could suit the Devil more than to watch the Church burn her wheat as she gathers the chaff?
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	The gates of Hell will not prevail against the Church, as Our Lord promised.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	But they won’t stop trying, either.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	They’ve attacked from the front, sending the Roman pagans, French Revolutionaries, and British American secularists.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	They flank us by sending heretics like Arius, Luther, and Hans Kung.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	Today, there’s also a fifth column working to tear down the walls from within – not only pedophiles like John Geoghan, but also predators like Theodore McCarrick.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Where did those fifth columnists enter?
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	Why, there’s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Aggiornamento sounds like a Lefebvrist slur.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	The idea that an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church would openly seek to “bring itself up to date” is ridiculous.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Yet that was precisely the aim.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	As St Pope John XXIII explained, “Its principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the Church after 20 centuries of life.” It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	The goal was to align the Church more with modern world: a world defined, to a considerable extent, by its rejection of the Catholic world that flourished before the Protestant Reformation and French Revolution.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Now, I don’t believe Pope John saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred, immutable tradition.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	I share Pope Paul IV’s view.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	When he heard that the Council was being convened, then-Cardinal Montini is supposed to have sighed, “This holy old boy doesn’t realise what a hornet’s nest he’s stirring up.”
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Nonetheless, he stirred it.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	The spirit of aggiornamento quickly spread through the Church in the 1960s – and the seminaries especially.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Seminarians called for a more “participatory” administration.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	They became involved in socialist politics.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	They formed trade unions to demand the right to marry.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	They practiced sauvage intercommunion.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Of course, they had their enablers in the hierarchy as well.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Perhaps the worst was Archbishop Marty of Paris, a leader of the “priest-worker movement” who defended Marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the Council.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	During a homily at the Cathedral, he also praised the soixantehuitards: “the great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its place in life” that occurred in his city in May of 1968.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	“One also felt that, in these events of May,” Marty continued, “the seriousness of the working class, which wants not only to earn a living wage, but also to find its freedom, its independence.” Theaggiornamentistas was never purged from the Church, and certainly not from the seminaries.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	As the modern world continued to reject traditional Christian mores, so too does the Church seem increasingly “out of step” and in need of “modernizing”.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Inevitably, this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, infamously spoke of “an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.”
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	But that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Rather, the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more (shall we say) opportunities for gay men – given that there are, of course, no women in Catholic seminaries.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	This began driving away heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church’s teachings on chastity and celibacy.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	Needless to say, not all gay priests are violent predators like McCarrick.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	But the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to “seduce” his victims.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Many have also speculated that, because McCarrick’s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent, the media didn’t consider them newsworthy.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	If he’d fondled a 12-year old altar boy, that would have been one thing.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	Pedophile priests sell papers.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	But taking an 18-year-old seminarian to bed?
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	Running that story would simply be outing a closeted gay man: an act the liberal press would no doubt consider “homophobic”, as Ross Douthat pointed out.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, those bishops who didn’t approve of his actions knew the culture – both within the Church and without her – were against them.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	The post-Vatican Church doesn’t like to come off as a nag.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	She’s not going to cause a fuss by purging sexually active gay men from the clergy just because… what?
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	It’s immoral?
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	That’s not very aggiornamentistic!
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	The world and our worldly bishops were, unsurprisingly, of one mind.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	And even if they were disgusted by McCarrick, these prelates weren’t willing to jeopardize their careers by standing for justice against vice.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	We seem to be slouching back to the old traditionalist trope: All the Church’s problems would be solved if we’d just go back to the Latin Mass.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	Something went critically wrong during Vatican II that extends well beyond the Mass.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	And we can’t drag the Church out of her present crisis until we have the courage to brave accusations of “Lefebvrism” and say so.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	Those who love our Holy Mother – those who want to protect her boys and men from all the McCarricks and their perverse appetites – mustn’t be deceived into thinking this is a small or an isolated issue.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	It isn’t.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	This is the crisis of an ancient and immortal institution trying desperately to seem young and fashionable; like all old men, it only manages to come across as lecherous and pathetic.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Its obsession with “modernization” leads it to only adopt the vices of modernity.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Instead of serving as ambassadors from the City of God, far too many of our priests and prelates have become agents of the City of Man.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	I don’t know what it will take to set things right.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	I don’t know what it will take to exorcise the “spirit of Vatican II” – the spirit of aggiornamento – from the Church.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	propaganda	But we will.
782017101	Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II	non-propaganda	Christ promised.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The Cunning CIA
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Whatever else might be said about the assassination of President Kennedy, one thing is for sure: The cover-up of this particular U.S. regime-change operation was one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	This shouldn’t surprise anyone, given that practically from its inception in 1947 the CIA was specializing in the arts of assassination, regime change, and cover-up.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	As far back as 1953, the CIA published an assassination manual that the CIA succeeded in keeping secret from the American people for more than 40 years.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	It came to light in 1997 as a result of a Freedom of Information request.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	That was around the time that the Assassination Records Review Board, which was overseeing the mandatory release of JFK-related assassination records of the CIA and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the American people since 1963.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Today, Americans can read the CIA’s assassination manual online.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Titled “Study of Assassination,” the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Here is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms:
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Firearms are often used in assassination, often very ineffectively….
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Public figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The propaganda value of this system may be very high.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Time to buy old US gold coins
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The manual also makes it clear that the CIA was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Note the following excerpt:
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	For secret assassination, either simple or chase, the contrived accident is the most effective technique.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	When successfully executed, it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	It would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	That’s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	We can also assume that the CIA continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone.

703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	The CIA published that secret assassination manual as part of its preparations for a U.S. regime-change operation in Guatemala, one that was designed to violently remove the nation’s democratically elected socialist president, Jacobo Arbenz, from office and replace him with an unelected, right-wing, pro-U.S. military general.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	As part of the Guatemala regime-change operation, the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	While the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination, there is little doubt that Arbenz, the president, was at the top of the list.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	There is something important to note: Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	So, why were they targeted for assassination?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Because Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as John Kennedy would do ten years later.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	That’s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Although Arbenz was able to escape the country, the CIA’s regime-change operation was a total success, with Arbenz being replaced by the pro-U.S. Gen. Carlos Castillo Armas, who proceeded to instigate a reign of terror across Guatemala.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	The Guatemalan operation was brilliant and ingenious.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting “national security” by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Tracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA’s second-highest medal.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	The CIA’s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	At a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound — the one in the front of Kennedy’s neck — was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	This necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Keep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	But he also went a step further.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	He said that he was being framed for the crime.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Wouldn’t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	That’s where the brilliance, ingenuity, and cunningness of the cover-up come into play.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	If Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Who would those confederates be?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	There could be only one answer: communists.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Soviet and Cuban communists, to be more specific.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	How would we know this?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	That’s where Oswald’s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Oswald traveled to Mexico City where he purportedly visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the Soviet Union.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Keep in mind that this was the height of the Cold War between the United States and that the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, had taken place the previous year.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	So, President Kennedy has been assassinated.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Oswald is immediately arrested.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	He has confederates firing from the front, who almost certainly are Soviet and Cuban communists, especially since Oswald has supposedly just recently visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	What does all that mean?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	An assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	That means nuclear war is about to break out because there is no way that the United States is going to sit idly by when the Reds have just assassinated America’s president.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Except for one thing: The communist part and the nuclear-war part were concocted.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	That was all part of the plan.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	That was the ingenious way that the CIA was able to get the investigation into the assassination squelched just as soon as Oswald was murdered.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	In the early days of the Warren Commission, commission chairman Earl Warren called a top-secret meeting of the commission.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Its purpose was to discuss information that Warren had received that Oswald was actually a U.S. intelligence agent or an informant for the FBI or both.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	How did Warren resolve this troubling issue?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	He simply asked the heads of the CIA and FBI whether it was true.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	They said no.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	That was the end of the matter.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	The issue was so sensitive that Warren ordered the members of the commission to never reveal the meeting to the American people.

703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	He also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Unbeknownst to him, the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	This troubling issue arose again yesterday, November 2, in the Washington Post in an article entitled “Tantalizing Mystery of JFK Assassination Files Solved – 23 Years Ago.” In the article, author Ian Shapira points out that among the long-secret CIA records that were recently released was a deposition of former CIA Director Richard Helms taken in 1975 before the President’s Commission on CIA Activities, which stated as follows:
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	BELIN: Well, now, the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the CIA was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of President Kennedy.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	During the time of the Warren Commission, you were Deputy Director of Plans, is that correct?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	HELMS: I believe so.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	BELIN: Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an age[nt.… The CIA, Terrorism, an... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	That’s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the CIA that were recently released by the National Archives.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Shapira points out, “Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, seized on the truncated file as an example of the government’s continued secrecy about the assassination.” Shapira points out that Helms’ full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	(The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board, the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone’s movie JFK, which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime-change operation, no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before.)
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Shapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave, which, as he points out, has been public:
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	HELMS: Mr. Belin, this question, and I think you may recall this, was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever, and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	As far as the FBI was concerned, my recollection is not all that precise.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	I believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	He was certainly not an agent of the CIA.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	He was certainly never used by the CIA.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Whether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I don’t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable — I believe Mr. [John] McCone [a previous CIA director] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	I believe he was asked to testify.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	It was a hot item anyway at the time.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	And my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Shapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research, maybe even use Google, before they jump to conclusions.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	But Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	That’s because he failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former CIA Director Richard Helms.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	What is that great big important point that Shapira, who, according to his tagline on his article, “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities,” left out of his article?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Perjury.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	He left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	A liar.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	A CIA official who would tell falsehoods, even under oath, whenever he felt that “national security” required it.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Shapira failed to note that Helms was convicted in a federal district court of lying to Congress under oath about another CIA regime-change operation ten years after the Kennedy assassination in Chile.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Interesting enough, in the Chile regime-change operation, the CIA and the Pentagon were telling their counterparts in the Chilean national-security establishment that they had a moral duty to violate their nation’s constitution and violently remove their nation’s democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, from office.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The reason?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Allende was reaching out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as Arbenz had done and just as Kennedy had done.

703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Thus, given that Helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar, what value does his denial that Oswald was an intelligence agent have?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	It has no value at all.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	And Shapira, who “enjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities” had an ethical duty to point out Helms’ proclivity for lying in his article.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Oswald was working for U.S. intelligence.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	If Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s, given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Why would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered, on a moment’s notice, to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam, Laos, China, the Soviet Union, or Europe to kill communists?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Don’t forget: this is the height of the Cold War!
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	After Oswald supposedly tried to “defect” to the Soviet Union and promised to give the Russians all the secrets he learned about in the military, why would U.S. officials agree to let him back in the country, and with a communist wife?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Why wouldn’t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Why wouldn’t they harass, abuse, humiliate, persecute, or prosecute him, like they did to Martin Luther King, Dalton Trumbo, John Walker Lindh, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and other people they have deemed to be communists or traitors?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	How is it possible that Oswald could learn fluent Russian while serving in the U.S. military without having U.S. military tutors teaching him?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	How is it possible that a veteran who embarrasses the U.S. Marine Corps by openly proselytizing for communism in New Orleans is able to saunter across the Cold War stage of history, not long after the McCarthy hearings, without nary a care in the world?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	The answer: Helms lied.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	There is no reasonable doubt that Oswald was a U.S. intelligence agent, one who was ordered to travel to Mexico City to set the framework for his frame-up.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	But things obviously went dreadfully wrong in Mexico City, which is why the CIA had to shut down that part of the post-assassination investigation.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Not surprisingly, the CIA’s Mexico City operations regarding Oswald are among the 98 percent of the records that Trump and the CIA have chosen to continue keeping secret from the American people, on grounds of “national security” of course.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Thus, when Oswald was claiming that he was being framed, there could be only one entity that he could have been thinking about: the CIA, the agency whose officials, as former Washington Post investigative reporter Jefferson Morley has documented, were secretly monitoring his activities in the weeks leading up to the assassination, no doubt to ensure that Oswald had not figured out what was about to happen to him.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	We can assume that any frame-up by the CIA is going to be good.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The operation is going to be carefully planned and executed.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	But no plan is perfect.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Things are inevitably going to go wrong.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The pieces aren’t going to fit together perfectly.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The Mexico City operation is a good example of that.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	That’s why the CIA has to continue keeping those records secret.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	But here’s another example, a small but important one: Recall that Oswald supposedly hid the rifle before he headed down the steps from the sixth floor of the school book depository.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Ask yourself: If someone has just assassinated the president of the United States, is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	What good would that do?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Wouldn’t officials conduct a thorough search of the area?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Wouldn’t an assassin instead simply leave the rifle there and get out of there as soon as he could?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Then why the hidden rifle?
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Because it’s consistent with a frame-up.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The framers had to hide the rifle in advance in a place where no one CIA & JFK: The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	would see it during the morning of the assassination, which took place after noon.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	No matter how good a frame-up was, the CIA knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	That’s where ingenuity and cunning come into play.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	They had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frame-up would remain intact.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	That’s why they had shots fired from the front and placed Oswald in the rear.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	The idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald’s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately, especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting, in partnership with the Mafia, to assassinate Castro.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	It was one of the most brilliant and cunning ruses in history.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	They get the body out of Parkland by force, in violation of Texas law, and put it in the hands of the military in Maryland, which conducts a secret fraudulent and bogus autopsy.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	(See my book The Kennedy Autopsy.)
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Lyndon Johnson telephones Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade on the night of the assassination and orders him to shut down any investigation of a conspiracy because it might lead to nuclear war.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	As soon as Oswald is assassinated, the FBI orders Wade to turn over all his investigative files to the FBI.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	At the same time, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Lyndon Johnson gets Earl Warren and Sen. Richard Russel to join the Warren Commission by telling them that the assassination could lead to World War III.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Johnson appoints former CIA Director Allan Dulles, who Kennedy had fired as a result of the CIA’s regime-change operation at the Bay of Pigs, to the Warren Commission, thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the CIA.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	Then keep all the records secret for decades, when many people won’t care anymore who killed President Kennedy.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	non-propaganda	And employ Operation Mockingbird-like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative “conspiracy theories” to confound and confuse the public.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	And smear anyone who questions the official narrative as a “communist sympathizer” or a “conspiracy theorist.”
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	The CIA’s cunning cover-up in the JFK assassination worked brilliantly.
703821117	The Cunning CIA	propaganda	Thanks to President Trump and the CIA’s decision to continue keeping 98 percent of the CIA’s decades-long secret records secret from the American people, the CIA’s cunning cover-up of the JFK assassination continues to work brilliantly today.

761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	What has been done: 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation.

761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Another Carmel was renewed in 1990.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	At the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing; it is run by Franciscan sisters.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	With the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation, according to the faculties described in the statutes, in particular regarding our mutual solidarity.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Also, with the passing of the years, the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Finally, the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Due to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	We are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	The structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Possible solutions: The Federation Council, the Religious Assistant, together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious, have worked hard on a completely new structure, in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	We began from three points:
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist, but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation, preferably appointed by the Superior General.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	The team will consist of a president and vice-president who are members of one of the convents, appointed to functions, and of three people who are members, or not, of one of the convents.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	3)A Supervisory council, also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General, which will be made up of three members, whose president will be, preferably, a member of a religious institute, preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	This council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	In October 2008, the President, the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	They had meetings with Fr.

761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	These were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	An important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	We were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter, but we think that, in view of our present situation today, we do not have much choice.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	It is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Definitive permission came at the 25th of February.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	~~~
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	propaganda	Given this incredible picture of a Carmelite Order in the last rattle of its death throes, the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in Avila read as outright surreal, leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Sr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious told them that the “two great challenges to our contemplative life” are “the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.” She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Cor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	The nuns were exhorted to “stay awake to welcome the dawn” of a bright new future:
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	“These are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.” “Our aim must be to be open to the future.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	We should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	It is a wide road that opens up before us.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	We must be women of hope and faith.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	We must always believe that God is the one who directs history.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	From this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).” [emphasis in the original.]
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	propaganda	While there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the Carmelite Order in Western Europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present, it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Instead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the “problems and difficulties that we can encounter” in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including “consumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.”
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	propaganda	What are these people smoking?
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Given that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis/Kasper, one wonders what this “new dawn” was actually about.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	propaganda	Perhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been, “A ‘new dawn’ of what, exactly?” This kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the Church since the 1960s, when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new Church.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Was Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	It is certainly clear from Francis’ first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	His first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation’s Secretary and – given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them – the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	propaganda	The first task Francis gave Carballo was the demolition of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Certainly this record of the European Carmelites’ meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	On the final day of the meeting, the “theme for the day” was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: “Government: the need for change.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	Autonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	General; other solutions to government.”
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	The devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone’s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: “Essential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,” the Father General warned.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	And there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works.
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	A common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to “ask questions” rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	“Who discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people?
761334950	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?	non-propaganda	“Are there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations?

774145019	Obama Was Never As Tough On Russia As Trump	non-propaganda	Our relationship with Russia is at a significant low point where just having some conversations can lead us to a better outcome.
774145019	Obama Was Never As Tough On Russia As Trump	non-propaganda	And there are so many important things that they are involved with that we care about, whether it’s Syria, Ukraine, North Korea or nuclear arms.
774145019	Obama Was Never As Tough On Russia As Trump	non-propaganda	I’m kind of surprised there’s been this much angst over this press conference.

774145019	Obama Was Never As Tough On Russia As Trump	propaganda	First, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.
774145019	Obama Was Never As Tough On Russia As Trump	propaganda	The very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America.

774145019	Obama Was Never As Tough On Russia As Trump	propaganda	Beyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia: Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.

774145019	Obama Was Never As Tough On Russia As Trump	propaganda	Any intellectually honest review of the last decade of foreign policy would lead one to admit that President Trump has most assuredly been tougher on Putin and Russia than Obama ever was.

111111124	Agencies scramble to prep Russia probe files for release after sweeping Trump order	non-propaganda	“The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”

111111124	Agencies scramble to prep Russia probe files for release after sweeping Trump order	propaganda	The text messages are expected to take longer because of the sheer number involved and the fact that Trump ordered their release without redactions.
111111124	Agencies scramble to prep Russia probe files for release after sweeping Trump order	propaganda	Republicans on Capitol Hill, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are touting the president’s order, saying it covers “pretty much everything that he wanted…and the text messages are a bonus,” a source said of Nunes.

711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	I was going to be among a group of freedom-fighters – a true rainbow coalition of human rights activists from all over the world (a Hindu princess had been set to join us) – to honor the memory of Lee Rigby, the British soldier who had been murdered on a London street in broad daylight by an Islamic jihadist on May 22, 2013.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	We planned to pay our respects to Lee Rigby by placing a wreath at his memorial, in his memory and in memory of his service.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	We planned to bring the Stars and Stripes, as well as British and Danish flags, and participate in Armed Forces Day memorial commemorations at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, where Rigby served.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	For this, we were banned.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	When Prime Minister Theresa May, who was the head of the Home Office when she banned us and was thus directly responsible for the ban, threw us under the bus in order to satiate savages who threatened violence, did she really think she or anyone would be safe?
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	Safe by surrender?
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	When did they ever work in the history of humankind?
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	The über-left pol citing the Geller-Spencer ban in the U.K. to ban Trump was inevitable.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	It’s like the Geller ban on ads on buses and subways in every major American city: the Catholic Church just tried to run ads on buses in Washington, D.C., and discovered that it couldn’t because of the ban on all political ads that was enacted in order to prevent my ads from running.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	Once you sanction the silencing and persecution of one, inevitably, you’ve sanctioned it for all.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	It’s open season on the opposition.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	Who decides what’s good and what’s forbidden in a totalitarian society?
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	The totalitarians.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	The worldwide howl at Trump’s retweets of videos tweeted out by a British politician is further proof of the Islamization of the West.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	It speaks to how deeply and far and widely sharia has been normed and accepted by Western elites.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	The videos in the retweets are authentic and have circulated for years.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	They’re neither “far-right” nor “Islamophobic”; they’re just factual.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	Once again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	Trump didn’t add any rhetoric to his tweets.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	He retweeted authentic videos.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	(The Dutch media now claim that one of them doesn’t depict Muslim migrants being violent, as was claimed.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	Even if this is true, Muslim migrant violence is a grim and increasingly common reality in Europe.)
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	If Muslims sincerely condemn jihad terror and sharia oppression, they shouldn’t oppose him.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	In a letter to May, Bryant wrote: “I am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	In retweeting Jayda Fransen’s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	This activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	Ms Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	Many of the people you have rightly banned from entering the UK were guilty of less than this.”
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	“Fascism.” By that Bryant means “defending British values.”
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	propaganda	While admitting numerous jihad preachers, Britain is keeping out the voices of sanity that would call that nation back to a path that would secure freedom for her children and her children’s children instead of a path to national suicide.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	And now a call to ban the president of the nation that saved their nation from extinction not 70 years ago.
711964584	British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too	non-propaganda	The full story of my being banned from the UK for standing against jihad, and much more, is in my new book, FATWA: Hunted in America .

711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	The brouhaha over President Trump’s retweets of videos depicting Muslims being violent continues in the UK, and is yet another manifestation of the general tendency to blame those who call attention to jihad atrocities rather than to focus upon the jihad atrocities themselves.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	Trump himself said it best, tweeting yesterday evening:”.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	@ Theresa_May, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.

711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2017
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	I’m not sure we’re doing just fine, but Trump is right that the real problem is jihad terror and Sharia supremacism, and British authorities want to ignore that and shoot the messenger.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	And so Chris Bryant, “a senior Labour backbencher, has written to May urging her to go further, and issue an official ban on Donald Trump from entering the UK on the grounds he is condoning fascism and his presence is ‘not conducive to the public good’, a senior Labour MP has said.”
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	For Chris Bryant, apparently “fascism” means “defense of Britain and its values against jihad terror.”
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	Bryant “cited the cases of two US far-right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller , who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump.”
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	Why are we “far right”?
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	Everything we do is in defense of the freedom of speech and equality of rights of all people before the law.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	That’s “far right”?
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	In any case, note well: the letter to me from the UK Home Office said that I was banned for saying that “[Islam] is a religion and is a belief system that mandates warfare against unbelievers…”
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	That’s a demonstrably true statement.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: “If there’s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	One – the easiest one maybe – chop their head off, that’s the easiest.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	Second – burn them to death.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	Third – throw ’em off a cliff.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	Fourth – tear down a wall on them so they die under that.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	Fifth – a combination of the above.”
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	propaganda	May’s government admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country.
711622457	UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country	non-propaganda	Chris Bryant had nothing to say about any of those jihad preachers entering Britain with no problem.

762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	But this is a case where Obama Inc. tried to get them to do the wrong thing.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	While they did the right thing.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	The Obama administration secretly sought to give Iran access — albeit briefly — to the U.S. financial system by sidestepping sanctions kept in place after the 2015 nuclear deal, despite repeatedly telling Congress and the public it had no plans to do so.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	propaganda	Yet another Obama dirty deal with Iran that we're just learning about now.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	propaganda	The question is how many more are there?
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	And that's part of why Spygate is happening.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	The assault is also a cover-up.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	The report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016, never previously disclosed, that would have allowed Iran to convert $5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman from Omani rials into euros by exchanging them first into U.S. dollars.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	If the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license, it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	The effort was unsuccessful because American banks — themselves afraid of running afoul of U.S. sanctions — declined to participate.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	The Obama administration approached two U.S. banks to facilitate the conversion, the report said, but both refused, citing the reputational risk of doing business with or for Iran.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	propaganda	That's how bad Obama was on Iran.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	The banking system was more reluctant to help Iran launder money than he was.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	Nor was Obama worried about the reputational risk of loading foreign currency on unmarked cargo planes and flying it to Iran.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	Issuing the license was not illegal.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	Still, it went above and beyond what the Obama administration was required to do under the terms of the nuclear agreement.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	Except Obama Inc. weren't trying to drive a hard bargain.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	So they didn't stick to it.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	They were trying to aid Iran.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	propaganda	Shortly after the nuclear deal was sealed in July 2015, then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew testified that even with the sanctions relief, Iran “will continue to be denied access to the world’s largest financial and commercial market.” A month later, one of Lew’s top deputies, Adam Szubin, testified that despite the nuclear deal “Iran will be denied access to the world’s most important market and unable to deal in the world’s most important currency.”
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	propaganda	This was typical of the worthless assurances that Obama officials made.

762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	Obama administration officials at the time assured concerned lawmakers that a general license wouldn’t be coming.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	But the report from the Republican members of the Senate panel showed that a draft of the license was indeed prepared, though it was never published.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	non-propaganda	And when questioned by lawmakers about the possibility of granting Iran any kind of access to the U.S. financial system, Obama-era officials never volunteered that the specific license for Bank Muscat in Oman had been issued two months earlier.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	propaganda	Scandal-free administration, folks.
762160164	Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused	propaganda	Not a single scandal to see here.

711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	A San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	The jury of six men and six women, including three immigrants, found the Mexican national not guilty of all murder and manslaughter charges and guilty only of felony possession of a firearm.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	For Garcia’s Zarate’s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	“For those who might criticize this verdict – there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,” Gonzalez said after the verdict, “the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	Let me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.”
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	“From day one this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,” added defense attorney Francisco Ugarte.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	“It was used to catapult a presidency along that philosophy of hate of others.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	I believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.”
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	Alex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor’s office told reporters the verdict “was not the one we were hoping for,” but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	“We’re just shocked — saddened and shocked ... that’s about it,” Jim Steinle, Kate’s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	“There’s no other way you can coin it.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	Justice was rendered, but it was not served.” Kate’s brother Brad was “stunned that they couldn’t even get him on using the weapon.”
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	Attorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant’s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	The verdict, Wohl said, was “an utter and complete and total failure by the prosecutor.”
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	Conservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was “horrifying.

711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	For his part, President Trump tweeted: “A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.”
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	Mexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times.

711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	On July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	The Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	During the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate’s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	As Gonzalez argued, “If this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?”
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	That sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	The felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	Since Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	San Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	Should that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	propaganda	He has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California, false-documented illegals are a privileged class.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight.
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	When that happens, the killer’s public defender will call it a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”
711566593	No Justice for Kate Steinle	non-propaganda	In San Francisco, and across California, this verdict will surely give new meaning to the cry of “no justice, no peace.”

790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s outstanding performance at yesterday’s evidentiary hearing featuring attempted rape accuser Christine Blasey Ford may have revived his embattled nomination for the highest court in America.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	The meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the underhanded tactics employed by the Left against Judge Kavanaugh.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	The nominee and Republican senators used the opportunity to attack desperate Democrats for their efforts at character assassination.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	President Trump was delighted.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him[,]” President Trump tweeted at 6:46 p.m. after the hearing wrapped up.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	The Senate must vote!”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Ford, who claims Kavanaugh tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for several hours Thursday.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Kavanaugh testified separately after Ford’s testimony concluded.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	Kavanaugh stole the show.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	The judge forcefully stood up for himself as his voice trembled with righteous indignation, calling out Democratic senators for plotting against him.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Those efforts didn't work.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee, and by staff.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	It would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	And then, and then as no doubt was expected, if not planned, came a long series of false last-minute smears designed to scare me and drive me out of the process before any hearing occurred.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	Afraid of their own shadows, committee Republicans didn’t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to examine Ford.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Opinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	She tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself, instead focusing on process-related questions, presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	In much of her testimony, Ford came across as presentable and seemingly credible, though vague and sometimes evasive, her ridiculous overall story notwithstanding.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Ford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh’s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	It’s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	She could do little else.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	She had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	As commentator Sean Davis tweeted:
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	“Hard to do much else when the witness conveniently has no corroborating evidence, no memory of any verifiable facts of what happened, and everyone she says was present at the alleged incident--even her best friend--has denied it.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Nonetheless, Mitchell’s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	She failed to lay a glove on a witness whose implausible, internally contradictory story cried out for vigorous cross-examination.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	In the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Whether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh’s side remains to be seen.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	Like other Democrats, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii tried to help Ford, lobbing her softballs.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	After saying she thought she knew what Mitchell was trying to get at in her questions, the senator said, “so I'll just ask you very plainly, Dr. Ford, is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your account of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh?”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“No, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,” Ford replied.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	When Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford “with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?” Ford replied, “one hundred percent.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	Strangely, Ford has a bad long-term memory and a bad short-term memory.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	She doesn’t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is “one hundred percent” certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	At the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through –including the Democrats’ sordid behavior— since President Trump announced the judge’s nomination on July 9.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	As part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	“Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there a whiff of any issue – any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior,” Grassley said.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Ford shared her allegations in a letter to the committee’s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	The letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Instead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Before the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn’t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	The committee held a four-day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Feinstein didn’t attend it, Grassley said.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Kavanaugh answered almost 1,300 written questions senators submitted after the hearing.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	That is “more than all prior Supreme Court nominees,” he said.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“Throughout this period, we did not know about the ranking member's secret evidence.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Then, only at an 11th hour, on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	And then, sadly, the allegations were leaked to the press.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“Every step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation,” Grassley said.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	After Ford’s identity became public, Grassley’s staff “contacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article,” he said.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Kavanaugh “immediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	He denied the allegations categorically.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“Democratic staff was invited to participate and could have asked any questions they wanted to, but they declined.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	Which leads me then to wonder: If they're really concerned with going to the truth, why wouldn't you want to talk to the accused?”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Grassley said his staff contacted the other individuals who allegedly attended the party at which the conduct Ford complained of allegedly took place: Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Keyser.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“All three submitted statements to the Senate under – under penalty of felony, denying any knowledge of the events described by Dr. Ford.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Dr. Ford's lifelong friend, Dr. – Miss Keyser, stated she doesn't know Judge Kavanaugh and doesn't recall ever attending a party with him.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Grassley said his staff repeatedly sought to interview Ford over the past 11 days, “even volunteering to fly to California to take her testimony, but her attorneys refused to prevent – present her allegations to Congress.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“Consistent with their stated desires to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination” by any means possible, “pushed for FBI investigations into the allegations.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“We've been trying to investigate other allegations,” Grassley said.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“At this time, we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients, and they have made no attempt to substantiate their claims.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Attorneys for new Kavanaugh accusers Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have been approached by committee staff on eight and six occasions, respectively, Grassley said.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“Neither attorney has made their clients available for interview.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	The committee can't do an investigation if attorneys are stonewalling.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	With his performance at the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is frequently a target of conservatives for going rogue on important issues, partly redeemed himself in the eyes of many conservatives.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	While questioning Kavanaugh, Graham lambasted the confirmation process the judge has been put through, calling it “the most unethical sham since I've been in politics.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Lashing out at Democrats, Graham said, “If you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	“Boy, you all want power,” he shouted.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“God, I hope you never get it.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	I hope the American people can see through this sham.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	Graham warned fellow GOPers about voting against the nomination.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	“To my Republican colleagues, if you vote no, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	You want this seat?
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	I hope you never get it.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) attacked Democrats, blaming them for the “circus atmosphere that has been created” since they first Ford's allegations to the media “two weeks ago, after sitting on them for six weeks.” This “has brought us the worst in our politics.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	“It certainly has brought us no closer to the truth,” Hatch added.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	“Anonymous letters with no name and no return address are now being treated as national news.” Taking a shot at Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, Hatch said “porn star lawyers with facially implausible claims are driving the news cycle.”
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	“I hate to say this, but this is worse than Robert Bork, and I didn't think it could get any worse than that.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	This is worse than Clarence Thomas.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	I didn't think it could get any worse than that.
790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	propaganda	This is a national disgrace, the way you're being treated.”

790677230	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?	non-propaganda	If Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.

780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump continued bashing Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation, saying cryptically Monday the special counsel is “looking for trouble.”
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	Trump alleged in a morning tweet series that the former FBI director is “Disgraced and discredited,” claiming his staff amounts to nothing more than a “group of Angry Democrat Thugs.”
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	That came hours after a Sunday tweet in which he referred to the special counsel team as a “gang.” Both are words with loaded meanings for his conservative political base.
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	non-propaganda	The president’s Sunday and Monday attacks on Mueller and his team came after reports that White House Counsel Donald McGahn was interviewed by Mueller and his team for more than one full day.
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	non-propaganda	Trump contends he signed off on the testimony; George W. Bush-era White House counsel and attorney general Alberto Gonzales, however, told CNN Monday morning that a sitting White House counsel would be required to fully cooperate with a federal investigation because he is a government lawyer, not a president’s personal attorney.
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	But Trump on Monday morning tweeted that McGahn spoke with the special counsel team for “over 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency.” (The tweet included a misspelling of “counsel.”)
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	The length of the Mueller-McGahn sessions led Trump to the conclusion the special counsel is “looking for trouble” because they “they know there is no Russian Collusion.”
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	non-propaganda	But Mueller reportedly is keenly interested in a widely studied June 2016 Trump Tower meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr., which included a Russian attorney who promised to hand over negative information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	The session also was attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner; the president dictated a misleading statement about it a year later and it remains murky just when he learned about the meeting.
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	non-propaganda	As Roll Call has reported, Trump was in the tower at the time of the session with the Russian lawyer.
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	The president also continued to push a line first floated by his attorney, former New York mayor and U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, tweeting that campaign collusion with Russia would be a “phony crime.” He’s right, there is no specific collusion statute.
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	But legal experts say anyone in Trump’s orbit would be charged with conspiracy, making false statements to federal investigators or obstructing justice.
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	All are federal crimes.
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	propaganda	Trump also continued to cast himself as a victim in the matter, saying when he attempts to “FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt,” his critics “scream Obstruction!”
780786973	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically	non-propaganda	Mueller also is looking at whether some of Trump’s actions like firing then-FBI Director James B. Comey or statements about the Russia probe since taking office amount to an attempt to interfere illegally with the special counsel probe.

741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	“Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base” was the Los Angeles Times headline, and this one is indeed a real mystery.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	A Muslim named Hafiz Kazi, according to the Times, “drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.” After scrutinizing all the evidence closely, the FBI just can’t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi’s motive.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	And that in a nutshell shows what’s wrong with today’s FBI.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	Sean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office, stated: “We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	Now the question is, why.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	Why was he there?
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	What led him there?
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	And we don’t know answers to that, quite frankly.”
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	The Times noted that when emergency responders approached the burning van after it crashed, “they found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said.”
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	Yes, what Kazi could possibly have been up to is a complete mystery.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	The Times added that “the dead man’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of ‘jihad’ video was found on Kazi’s phone.”
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	All right.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	No jihad video.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	And no “nexus of terrorism,” according to Sean Ragan.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	What is a nexus of terrorism?
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	Ragan most likely means that investigators didn’t find an ISIS membership card in Kazi’s wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, “I did this for Allah and Islam.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	Allahu akbar.”
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	Of course, even if they had found those things, given the FBI’s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi’s motive.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	In any case, a larger point is being lost here.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	And that is that there is a war going on.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	We know that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	We know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	Even if he wasn’t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	The FBI’s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	The FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	It doesn’t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	So each time something like this happens, they’re back at Square One, trying to figure out motive.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	It’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, to see if each one’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler’s war aims.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	Authorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	Here again, this is just more of the general refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room and screaming “Allahu akbar.” Sean Ragan might explain to us that authorities are also trying to determine whether the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 was motivated by Nazism, or by mental health issues among the German High Command.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	This willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic.
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	How long is this comic opera going to continue?
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	propaganda	If the jihadis advance even into the FBI’s Sacramento offices, will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis’ motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks?
741923579	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base	non-propaganda	Robert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch and author of the New York Times bestsellers The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) and The Truth About Muhammad.

698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	Police and hotel still don’t agree on some details.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	I realize that in the heat of a shooting, particularly a mass shooting, it may take some time for a precise timeline to develop.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	But it didn’t take very long for the Las Vegas police to release a precise timeline.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	The initial timeline was that Stephen Paddock’s shooting stopped when, approximately 6 minutes after he started, he was interrupted by a security guard from the Mandalay Bay hotel.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	Paddock then turned his fire into the hallway, firing some 200 bullets, and after that the shooting stopped as police arrived.

698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	WaPo reports:
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	propaganda	Las Vegas police said Friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage, contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week….
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	The confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	Lombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman’s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	MGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said….
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	Lombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	This six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	Police said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	MGM, though, said it was “confident” that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and “was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.” The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	On Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company’s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier “wasn’t inaccurate when I provided it.” Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log.
698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	Upon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m.

698092698	Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges	non-propaganda	Not so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock’s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below?

765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Two weeks after the trial began in early 1949, Pope Pius XII (having failed to speak out forcefully against the Third Reich) did summon the courage to condemn what was happening to Mindszenty.
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Pius excommunicated everyone involved in the Mindszenty trial.
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	Then, addressing a huge crowd on St. Peter’s Square, he asked, “Do you want a Church that remains silent when she should speak … a Church that does not condemn the suppression of conscience and does not stand up for the just liberty of the people … a Church that locks herself up within the four walls of her temple in unseemly sycophancy …?”

765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	The silence of what used to be the noble profession of journalism is deafening.
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	John Pilger — one of the few journalists to speak out on Julian Assange’s behalf, labels journalists who fail to stand in solidarity with Assange in exposing the behavior of the Establishment, “Vichy journalists — after the Vichy government that served ad enabled the German occupation of France.”
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Pilger adds:
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	“No investigative journalism in my lifetime can equal the importance of what WikiLeaks has done in calling rapacious power to account.
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	It is as if a one-way moral screen has been pushed back to expose the imperialism of liberal democracies: the commitment to endless warfare … When Harold Pinter accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005, he referred to ‘a vast tapestry of lies up on which we feed.’ He asked why ‘the systematic brutality, the widespread atrocities, the ruthless suppression of independent thought’ of the Soviet Union were well known in the West while America’s imperial crimes “never happened … even while [they] were happening, they never happened.’”

765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	In 2010, while he was still a free man, the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity gave its annual award to Assange.
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	The citation read:
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	“It seems altogether fitting and proper that this year’s award be presented in London, where Edmund Burke coined the expression “Fourth Estate.” Comparing the function of the press to that of the three Houses then in Parliament, Burke said: “…but in the Reporters Gallery yonder, there sits a Fourth Estate more important far then they all.” The year was 1787—the year the U.S. Constitution was adopted.
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	The First Amendment, approved four years later, aimed at ensuring that the press would be free of government interference.
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	That was then.
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	With the Fourth Estate now on life support, there is a high premium on the fledgling Fifth Estate, which uses the ether and is not susceptible of government or corporation control.
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	Small wonder that governments with lots to hide feel very threatened.
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	It has been said: “You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.” WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie.
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Last spring, when we chose WikiLeaks and Julian Assange for this award, Julian said he would accept only “on behalf or our sources, without which WikiLeaks’ contributions are of no significance.” We do not know if Pvt.
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	Bradley Manning gave WikiLeaks the gun-barrel video of July 12, 2007 called “Collateral Murder.” Whoever did provide that graphic footage, showing the brutality of the celebrated “surge” in Iraq, was certainly far more a patriot than the “mainstream” journalist embedded in that same Army unit.
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	He suppressed what happened in Baghdad that day, dismissed it as simply “one bad day in a surge that was filled with such days,” and then had the temerity to lavish praise on the unit in a book he called “The Good Soldiers.” Julian is right to emphasize that the world is deeply indebted to patriotic truth-tellers like the sources who provided the gun-barrel footage and the many documents on Afghanistan and Iraq to WikiLeaks.
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	We hope to have a chance to honor them in person in the future.
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Today we honor WikiLeaks, and one of its leaders, Julian Assange, for their ingenuity in creating a new highway by which important documentary evidence can make its way, quickly and confidentially, through the ether and into our in-boxes.
765982381	Julian Assange	propaganda	Long live the Fifth Estate!”
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Eventually a compromise was found in 1971 when Pope Paul VI lifted the excommunications and Mindszenty was able to leave the U.S. embassy.
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Can such a diplomatic solution be found to free Assange?
765982381	Julian Assange	non-propaganda	It is looking more and more unlikely with each passing year.

695833178	Confirmed: Authorities LIED About Las Vegas Shooter’s Hotel Check-In Date – What Else Are They Hiding?	propaganda	Now, new information released by investigative reporter Laura Loomer proves that authorities have directly lied to the American people about the case at least once by claiming that supposed shooter Stephen Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel on September 28th when valet records (with photos) prove he actually arrived three days earlier.
695833178	Confirmed: Authorities LIED About Las Vegas Shooter’s Hotel Check-In Date – What Else Are They Hiding?	propaganda	According to Loomer, she obtained the image from a source which shows that Paddock’s car first arrived September 25th.

789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	propaganda	Yet now the Democrats, including Feinstein, want to demand Christine Blasey Ford have her day in court, figuratively speaking, for her flimsy and meritless accusations against Kavanaugh?

789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	non-propaganda	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, has championed Brett Kavanaugh’s #MeToo accuser, but Juanita Broaddrick says the senator never showed any interest in her 1999 rape allegation against President Bill Clinton.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	non-propaganda	Ms. Feinstein was elected in 1992, making her one of the few remaining senators who served during independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation into Mr. Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	propaganda	“It’s absurd,” Ms. Broaddrick said Wednesday on Fox News.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	non-propaganda	“Not one Democrat would look at my deposition with the independent counsel.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	propaganda	Oh my gosh, they did not want to know about it.” She pointed to the discrepancy between Democratic lack of interest in her case and the party’s outrage over allegations of sexual assault leveled last week against Mr. Kavanaugh.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	non-propaganda	“Oh, it makes me go back to 1999, when Dianne Feinstein, along with every other Democrat, refused to read my deposition to the independent counsel,” said Ms. Broaddrick told Fox’s Laura Ingraham on Monday.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	non-propaganda	“They would have nothing to do with it.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	propaganda	That shows you the difference in the double standard that existed back then and still does today.” Ms. Broaddrick has also lashed out at Sen. Dick Durbin, Illinois Democrat, who voted not guilty on the Clinton impeachment, as did Ms. Feinstein and Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	non-propaganda	“You voted NOT GUILTY on both counts at Bill Clinton’s impeachment,” she tweeted.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	propaganda	“You didn’t give a damn back then.
789121265	Juanita Broaddrick: Senator Feinstein Had No Interest In My Rape Allegation	propaganda	You, Dicky Durban [sic], are a complete FRAUD.” Ms. Broaddrick also said that if Senate Democrats want the FBI to investigate the 36-year-old accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh, they should reopen her 40-year-old case, too.

111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	propaganda	More critical, in Trump's telling, was the development of a personal bond with Kim, a brutal dictator responsible for the deaths not only of his own citizens but of at least one American, Otto Warmbier, who was returned to the US in a coma only to die days later.
111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	non-propaganda	"""I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past,"" Trump said during the summit."

111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	non-propaganda	"""Without Otto, this would not have happened,"" Trump said."
111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	propaganda	Trump and Kim -- both intent on making history -- greeted each other early in the day with extended hands in front of a row of US and North Korean flags, a previously unthinkable sight that reflects a new chapter in the two countries' acrimonious relationship.
111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	non-propaganda	Trump's threats to politely walk out of the meeting if his expectations were unmet did not materialize.

111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	non-propaganda	The remarks came amid an improbable series of events that few could have anticipated even three months ago.
111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	non-propaganda	The unlikely images of US and North Korean counterparts engaging in friendly dialogue lent the day an air of unreality.

111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	propaganda	At the conclusion of the summit, Trump hailed the talks as a historic, and personal, achievement.
111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	non-propaganda	"""We learned a lot about each other and our countries,"" Trump said."
111111131	Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim	propaganda	"""I learned he's a very talented man."""

7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	Trump tweeted out the news on Tuesday.

7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	The Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump’s tweet.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	Trump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	Trump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	Tillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	propaganda	His voice quivering, Tillerson thanked career diplomats for their “honesty and integrity” and the American people for “acts of kindness,” and he singled out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for their partnership and mutual support of diplomacy.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	But he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	propaganda	Tillerson said he will remain in his post until March 31 but is delegating all authorities for running the State Department to Deputy Secretary John Sullivan and is committed to ensuring “an orderly and smooth transition.” The deposed diplomat also made a clear statement about Russian aggression: “Much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.”
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	﻿
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	CNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday:
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	On Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	He “did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason” for his firing, the spokesman added.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	Two White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	The secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	Later, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration’s account of Tillerson’s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	Goldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	propaganda	Trump later told reporters he disagreed with Tillerson on some issues and feels the diplomat “will be much happier now.”
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	While many are happy that Tillerson is gone, many of us are concerned with Mike Pompeo being installed at Secretary of State, especially regarding his un-American comments against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who exposed the criminal activity of the Deep State in DC.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	Speaking of Snowden, he decided to chime in on the newly appointed CIA director, but did not say anything about Pompeo becoming Secretary of State.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	“The new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal cover-up.
7384471099	From Bad To Worse?	non-propaganda	Her name was on the Top Secret order demanding the destruction of tapes to prevent them being seen by Congress.

763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	In a recent communication between Randy Credico, an Assange supporter, comic and radio producer, and Adam Schiff, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, Assange’s fear of arrest and extradition to the US was confirmed by the leader of the Russia-gate frenzy.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Credico received the following response from Schiff after meeting the Congressman’s staff, in which Credico was trying to connect Assange with Schiff: “Our committee would be willing to interview Assange when he is in U.S.

763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Dennis Bernstein spoke with John Pilger, a close friend and supporter of Assange on May 29.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	The interview began with the statement Bernstein delivered for Pilger at the Left Forum last weekend in New York on a panel devoted to Assange entitled, “Russia-gate and WikiLeaks”.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Pilger’s Statement
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	“There is a silence among many who call themselves left.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	The silence is Julian Assange.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	As every false accusation has fallen away, every bogus smear shown to be the work of political enemies, Julian stands vindicated as one who has exposed a system that threatens humanity.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	The Collateral Damage video, the war logs of Afghanistan and Iraq, the Cablegate revelations, the Venezuela revelations, the Podesta email revelations … these are just a few of the storms of raw truth that have blown through the capitals of rapacious power.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	The fakery of Russia-gate, the collusion of a corrupt media and the shame of a legal system that pursues truth-tellers have not been able to hold back the raw truth of WikiLeaks revelations.

763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Julian Assange has never been more isolated.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	He needs your support and your voice.

763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Dennis Bernstein: We continue our discussion of the case of Julian Assange, now in the Ecuadorian embassy in Great Britain.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	John Pilger, it is great to talk to you again.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	But it is a profound tragedy, John, the way they are treating Julian Assange, this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalists have depended on in the past.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	He has been totally left out in the cold to fend for himself.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	John Pilger: I have never known anything like it.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	There is a kind of eerie silence around the Julian Assange case.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Julian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	He is cut off from the very tools of his trade, visitors aren’t allowed.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	I was in London recently and I couldn’t see him, although I spoke to people who had seen him.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador, said recently that he regarded what they are doing to Julian now as torture.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	It was Correa’s government that gave Julian political refuge, which has been betrayed now by his successor, the government led by Lenin Moreno, which is back to sucking up to the United States in the time-honored way, with Julian as the pawn and victim.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	Should be a ‘Constitutional Hero’
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	But really it comes down to the British government.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Although he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has Ecuadorian nationality, his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the British government.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	The United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	Britain took part in an investigation which determined that Julian was a political refugee and that a great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	It is very good that you are doing this, Dennis, because even in the media outside the mainstream, there is this silence about Julian.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	The streets outside the embassy are virtually empty, whereas they should be full of people saying that we are with you.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	The principles involved in this case are absolutely clear-cut.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Number one is justice.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	The injustice done to this man is legion, both in terms of the bogus Swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can’t leave without being arrested, extradited to the United States and ending up in a hell hole.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	But it is also about freedom of speech, about our right to know, which is enshrined in the United States Constitution.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	If the Constitution were taken literally, Julian would be a constitutional hero, actually.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Instead, I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage!
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	It’s so ridiculous.That is the situation as I see it, Dennis.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	It is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	DB: His journalistic brethren are sounding like his prosecutors.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	They want to get behind Russia-gate freaks like Congressman Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo, who would like to see Assange in jail forever or even executed.

763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	I have never known anything quite like it in my career.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	That said, it is not new.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	There has always been a so-called mainstream which really comes down to great power in media.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	It has always existed, particularly in the United States.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	The Pulitzer Prize this year was awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for witch-hunting around Russia-gate!
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	They were praised for “how deeply sourced their investigations were.” Their investigations turned up not a shred of real evidence to suggest any serious Russian intervention in the 2016 election.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Like Webb
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	The Julian Assange case reminds me of the Gary Webb case.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Bob Parry was one of Gary Webb’s few supporters in the media.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Webb’s “Dark Alliance” series contained evidence that cocaine trafficking was going on with the connivance of the CIA.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	Later Webb was hounded by fellow journalists and, unable to find work, he eventually committed suicide.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	The CIA Inspector General subsequently vindicated him.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Now, Julian Assange is a long way from taking his own life.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	His resilience is remarkable.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	But he is still a human being and he has taken such a battering.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	Probably the hardest thing for him to take is the utter hypocrisy of news organizations—like The New York Times, which published the WikiLeaks “War Logs” and “Cablegate,” The Washington Post and The Guardian, which has taken a vindictive delight in tormenting Julian.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	The Guardian a few years ago got a Pulitzer Prize writing about Snowden.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	But their coverage of Snowden left him in Hong Kong.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	It was WikiLeaks that got Snowden out of Hong Kong and to safety.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	Professionally, I find this one of the most unsavory and immoral things I have seen in my career.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	The persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from WikiLeaks.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	One of Assange’s great tormentors, The Guardian‘s Luke Harding, made a great deal of money with a Hollywood version of a book that he and David Lee wrote in which they basically attacked their source.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	I suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	My understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	They realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago, and that is to tell us how governments lie.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	DB: One thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the Western corporate press speculate about Russian involvement in the U.S. 2016 election, that it was a hack through Julian Assange.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Any serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	And yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed-off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders…this is not a part of the story!
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Eight Hundred Thousand Disclosures on Russia
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	JP: What happened to Sanders and the way that he was rolled by the Clinton organization, everybody knows that this is the story.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	And now we have the DNC suing WikiLeaks!
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	There’s a kind of farcical element to this.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	I mean, none of this came from the Russians.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	That WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians is ludicrous.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	WikiLeaks published about 800,000 major disclosures about Russia, some of them extremely critical of the Russian government.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	If you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and WikiLeaks gets the documents to show it, they will publish no matter who you are, be they the United States or Russia.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	DB: Randy Credico, because of his work and his decision to devote a very high-profile series to the persecution of Julian Assange, recently found himself under attack.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	He went to the White House Press Roast and, after having a nice discussion with Congressman Schiff, he yelled out “What about Julian Assange?” The room was packed full of reporters but Randy was attacked and dragged out.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	It was if everyone there was embarrassed to recognize that one of their brethren was being brutalized.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	JP: Randy shouted some truth.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	It is very similar to what happened to Ray McGovern.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Ray is a former member of the CIA but extremely principled.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	I might suggest he is a renegade now.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	DB: It was hysterical to watch these four armed guards who kept shouting “Stop resisting, stop resisting!” and they are beating the hell out of him!
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	JP: I thought the image of Ray being hauled off was particularly telling.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	These four overweight, obviously ill-trained young men manhandling Ray, who is 78 years old.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	There was something highly emblematic about that for me.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	He stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	It is both shocking and surreal, which of course the Julian Assange case is as well.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	But real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	There is so much collusion now, with all these dark and menacing developments.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	It is almost as if the word “journalism” is becoming blighted.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	DB: There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Then the word “collusion” is quite appropriate.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	JP:That’s the ultimate collusion.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	But that’s collusion with silence.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	Never has there been a collusion like the one between the U.S. and Israel.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	It suggests another word and that is “immunity.” It has a moral immunity, a cultural immunity, a geopolitical immunity, a legal immunity, and certainly a media immunity.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	We see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	Israel has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the Nakba and the right of return.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	In the media these were described as “clashes.” Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	A rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	All the talk of Iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the Middle East.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	DB: What would you say have been the contributions that Julian Assange has made in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism?
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Where does he come into the picture?
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	JP:I think it comes down to information.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	If you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	The right to know what governments are doing in our name—on our behalf or to our detriment—is our moral right.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Julian feels very passionately about this.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	There were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	There were times when I said to him, “Why don’t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it?” Of course, I knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was “no.” The enormous amount of information that has come from WikiLeaks, particularly in recent years, has amounted to an extraordinary public service.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	I was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	This was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	It detailed how subversion should work.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	Of course, they dressed it up as human rights work and so on.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	I was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	It also reminds us that so-called “meddling” by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	The word “meddling” doesn’t apply to the kind of action implied in this document.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	It is intervention in another country’s affairs.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	WikiLeaks has done that all over the world.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	It has given people the information they have a right to have.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	They had a right to find out from the so-called “War Logs” the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	They had a right to find out about Cablegate.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	That’s when, on Clinton’s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	You can see why Julian made enemies.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	But he should also have made a huge number of friends.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	This is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	I think WikiLeaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression “right to know.” This must explain why he is attacked so much, because that is so threatening.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	The enemy to great power is not the likes of the Taliban, it is us.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	DB: And who can forget the release of the “collateral murder” footage by Chelsea Manning?
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	JP: That kind of thing is not uncommon.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	Vietnam was meant to be the open war but really it wasn’t.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	There weren’t the cameras around.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	It is indeed shocking information but it informs people, and we have Chelsea Manning’s courage to thank for that.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	non-propaganda	DB: Yes, and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement.
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	They want to prosecute Assange and maybe hang him from the rafters in Congress, but what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?
763260610	The Eerie Silence	propaganda	There is no end of horrific examples of what passes for journalism, in contrast to the amazing contribution that Julian Assange has made.

735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	The media has maintained a tight embargo on the release of the photo of Obama meeting with Nation of Islam hate group leader Louis Farrakhan at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	Almost no national media outlet has covered the story.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	CNN only mentioned it when it embedded Jake Tapper's tweets about the support for Farrakhan by Women's March leaders.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	But Rep. Danny Davis had defended Farrakhan.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “outstanding human being” on Monday.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	Farrakhan’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people “deserve to die” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “very great man.” “I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	propaganda	The JTA's awkward attempt to whitewash the newly revealed CBC anti-Semitism included a claim from the ADL that Rep. Davis had been misquoted.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	propaganda	An ADL official told JTA on Friday that the group had reached out to Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat, after an article in The Daily Caller said he lauded Farrakhan on Monday as “an outstanding human being.” Farrakhan has calledJews “the enemy of God and the enemy of the righteous,” and said Jews were responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 20th century.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	propaganda	“The congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he didn’t subscribe to Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements and actions in the past,” the ADL official told JTA in a statement.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	“He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.” The official said the ADL had shared information with Davis about Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements, and that the organization was waiting to hear back from him.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	propaganda	Now, Rep. Davis would really like to emphasize that the ADL is wrong and he loves Farrakhan.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	propaganda	Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis confirmed in an interview Sunday that he has a personal relationship with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious anti-Semite, and said he isn’t bothered by Farrakhan’s position on “the Jewish question.” Farrakhan has repeatedly denounced Jews as “satanic,” praised Hitler as a “very great man” and has said that white people “deserve to die.” The congressman wasn’t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn’t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	“I think that was what they wanted to write.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	Nah, I don’t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don’t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,” Davis said.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	“That’s just one segment of what goes on in our world.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	propaganda	The world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	For those heavy into it, that’s their thing, but it ain’t my thing,” he said
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	propaganda	"The people who talk about the ""Jewish question"" are generally anti-Semites."
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	Somehow I don't think a white congressman would get away with saying that he agrees with David Duke on the environment but isn't especially concerned about his racism.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	non-propaganda	But black leaders have gotten away with playing that game with Farrakhan repeatedly.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	propaganda	But the ADL and the JTA will whitewash this again.
735815173	Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan	propaganda	And if they can't whitewash this, they'll ignore it.

780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	The two themes of the upcoming Synod of Bishops in Rome are none other than, Youth and Vocations.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	Sound familiar?
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	Do I hear the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report?
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	How inconvenient that the two targets of predatory clerics and prelates will be the subject of the Synod of Bishops.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	How inconvenient that the head of the Synod on Youth and Vocations, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, was the former roommate of the most prolific serial predator of youth and seminarians in the history of the American Church.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	How inconvenient that Farrell, Head of this Synod on Youth, roomed with the notorious Cardinal Theodore McCarrick for six years and never knew anything about McCarrick’s predatory behavior.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	How inconvenient that a global homosexual clergy predation scandal is erupting at a time when Francis wants the Synod to minimize that nagging and unmerciful Catholic catechism doctrine of homosexuality as “intrinsically disordered” by exploiting the naive views of the youth at the Synod.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	How inconvenient that homosexual predation is bankrupting the American Church and the Instrumentum Laboris, the working document of this Vatican Synodal Agenda, embraces the relaxation of the Church teachings on homosexuality.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	How inconvenient that the homosexual network of clergy and prelates were blasted as predators and coverup enablers in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, while the Instrumentum Laboris argues that:
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	“Some LGBT youths, through various contributions that were received by the General Secretariat of the Synod, wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the Church, while some Bishop Conferences ask themselves what to suggest to young people who decide to create homosexual instead of heterosexual couples and, above all, would like to be close to the Church.” §197 IL
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	How inconvenient that during a global prelate homosexual coverup scandal, the 2018 Synodal Bishop Conferences are exploring for ways during the Synod to discuss ways in which homosexual youths want to be “closer” to the Church!
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	How inconvenient that since 2013 during Francis’ impromptu airplane presser when he cleverly sent a powerful message to homosexual clerics, “Who Am I to Judge,” now Francis must judge the criminal predatory conduct of homosexual clergy and prelates who preyed on youth and seminarians.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	The emerging homosexual clergy scandal is just beginning to unfold.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	The laity will learn over the course of the next few years that the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests, bishops and cardinals who preyed on the youth, assaulted seminarians, promoted their own ilk, and punished any whistleblowers or noncompliant priests.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	Here is the dirty secret that is now emerging.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	Many in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the Church’s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	The personal wreckage brutally portrayed in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report is the direct result of a clerical culture which embraced homosexuality and groomed, recruited, and assaulted young people into this sordid lifestyle.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	Many priests, bishops, and cardinals practiced what Francis preached, ‘who am I to judge.’
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	The result?
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	A litany of lives of total moral, physical, emotional devastation suffered by victims of homosexual clerics.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	This is just the very beginning of the dark night of the soul of the Catholic Church.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	The upcoming Synod and its embrace of the “LGBT” lifestyle makes a mockery of the suffering of the clergy victims and justifies the decades-old scandal.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	Be forewarned that inviting young people from ages 16-29 to the Synod to discuss vocations with Bishops poses serious moral and physical dangers to these unsuspecting youth, many of whom think homosexuality is cool.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	And the Bishops know it.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	The full extent of the clerical predation in the hierarchy will take years to uncover.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	Until it has, this Synod must be cancelled while the civil authorities and law enforcement fully investigate the breadth and depth of the homosexual clerical predation.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	The warning signs and rainbow flags are flamboyantly flashing that the 2018 Synod on the Youth and Vocations in Rome presents great moral and physical exploitation of the youth.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	According to the Vatican, the chosen topic of the 2018 Synod, is an “expression of the Church’s pastoral concern for the young,” and is in continuity with the findings of the two-fold synod on the family and Francis’s post-synodal document Amoris Laetitia.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	We’ve caught on to his sneaky synodal tactics.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	Francis cleverly uses the synodal process to relax church doctrine by employing secular tools of surveys and focus groups.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	And, if the necessary results aren’t computed, they will skewer the results.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	Magisterium by majority vote or stuff the ballot box.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	propaganda	The only compelling “expression of the Church’s pastoral concern for the young” belongs in the full and transparent cooperation of criminal investigations into predatory homosexual predation.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	Turn over the documents secret archives involving predation, both in the Vatican and in the chanceries around the globe.
780619695	Francis and Farrell’s 'Sinod' on the Youth, #StopThe Synod2018	non-propaganda	That is the only expression that will demonstrate concern for the young.

111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	The president is doubling down on an increasingly risky candidate.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	Justice Anthony Kennedy gave President Donald Trump the biggest political gift possible when he announced his resignation in the spring.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	Even though not everything that’s gone wrong is Trump’s fault, he has managed to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to fill the empty seat on the court.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	It’s a good example of how badly Trump does his job more than a year and a half into his administration.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	To begin with, Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside, party-aligned groups, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	That included an unusually central role for the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	That wasn’t entirely a Trump mistake.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	His decision during the campaign to release a list of potential justices drafted by Leo reflected the reality-TV star’s weakness as a presidential candidate.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	The party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative; to reassure them, he publicly committed to their top goal.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	In some ways, that’s successful coalition-building, and what he’s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Still, it’s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives; it’s another to turn the whole process over to them.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	We don’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	We have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated by those around him, and that Kavanaugh is a good fit for Trump’s biases: The judge has Ivy League credentials and he passes Trump’s cut-of-his-jib test by looking the part.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	1
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Either way, Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	The judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	After all, he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat, eventually getting confirmed with only four Democratic votes after a long delay.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Kavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative, a hard-liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Nominating him, rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background, was bound to stir up trouble.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	It was also true, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned, that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh’s record, especially his service during the George W. Bush administration, was going to delay confirmation even more.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Senate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn’t be produced rapidly, which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	2
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Sometimes it’s worth taking risks.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Presidents who shy away from anything that’s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	It’s just very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer, but still very conservative, other option.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	3
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	When serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	It’s still not clear that Kavanaugh’s nomination is doomed, but it’s certainly in severe trouble.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Losing a high-profile fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	But there’s an art to minimizing damage.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	And Trump hasn’t learned it yet.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	For one thing, the president has made this an extremely high-profile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Whether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly isn’t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	It’s also the case that the more negative information comes out, the more it appears that the Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs in vetting and managing Kavanaugh.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	If the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh, the public might have concluded that it wasn’t Trump’s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, Trump’s behavior has been as erratic as ever.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	First he said that Brasey had to be heard; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	He sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	The White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn’t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	The sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can’t shoot straight and that he’s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	A botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on any initiative.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	And, for that matter, they’ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there’s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Trump’s professional reputation is already terrible, but everything counts.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Trump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	And yes, I call it the cut-of-his-jib test quite deliberately.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	It's no surprise that someone who hires based on what he thinks someone doing that job should look like, which seems to be based on hazy old-time Hollywood casting, would wind up with fewer women in his administration than any of his recent predecessors.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	I've argued that too much disclosure is required, and that Democrats (and any wavering Republicans) had more than enough information to make up their mind.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	I still think that's true.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	But it did leave Republicans vulnerable to claims about transparency which were likely to be popular -- most people, and the entire press corps, love transparency -- and vulnerable to bombshells in the documentary record which hadn't been initially disclosed.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	In the event, that's not what's causing the trouble, but still it's an example of Trump taking needless risks.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Some have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor if any cases stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	Perhaps.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	propaganda	There are plenty of other partisan, conservative judges, and plenty of conservative judges who lean towards an expansive view of presidential powers.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	And if Kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue, then he won't be in the majority on any future decision anyway.
111111122	Kavanaugh Nomination Is Exploding in Trump’s Face	non-propaganda	So, no, I don't think there's any good reason to think Kavanaugh would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected.

763440871	MAJOR NEW STUDY: Homeschooling Spikes Due to School Violence, Far-Left Bias	non-propaganda	According to a 33-year-long study conducted by the National Home Education Research Institute in Oregon, the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.
763440871	MAJOR NEW STUDY: Homeschooling Spikes Due to School Violence, Far-Left Bias	propaganda	As reported by The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Fla., was the last straw for scores of parents.

740356006	Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan	propaganda	Farrakhan’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people “deserve to die” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “very great man.” “I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC.
740356006	Rep.

740356006	Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan	non-propaganda	Then Rep. Davis' office issued a statement disavowing Farrakhan.
740356006	Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan	non-propaganda	And then Davis got right back to talking to the Daily Caller and disavowed the disavowal.
740356006	Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan	non-propaganda	“The congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he didn’t subscribe to Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements and actions in the past,” the ADL official told JTA in a statement.
740356006	Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan	non-propaganda	“He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.” The congressman wasn’t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn’t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday.

740356006	Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan	propaganda	The world is so much bigger than Farrakhan and the Jewish question and his position on that and so forth.

740356006	Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan	non-propaganda	And then he talked to the Daily Caller again.

Danny Davis thinks Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious racist and anti-Semite, does “outstanding work” but doesn’t agree with Farrakhan’s positions that white people are “devils” and Jewish people are satanic.

740356006	Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan	propaganda	But this is typical of the Dems and their useful idiots.

762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	The U.S. banks were pressured into complying with the deal.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	The Washington Times has more:
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	propaganda	The Obama administration — despite repeatedly assuring Congress that Iran would remain barred from the U.S. financial system — secretly mobilized to give Tehran access to American banks to convert the windfall of cash it received from sanctions relief under the 2015 nuclear deal into dollars, an investigative report by the Senate has revealed.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	A copy of the report, obtained by The Washington Times, outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction, all while misleading lawmakers about the activities.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	propaganda	The document, compiled by the Senate’s Republican-led chief investigative subcommittee, began circulating Tuesday, just as the Trump administration issued its harshest warnings to date to foreign governments and companies to avoid doing business with Iran or find themselves in the crosshairs of Washington’s reimposition of sanctions as part of Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	propaganda	“Companies doing business in Iran face substantial risks, and those risks are even greater as we reimpose nuclear-related sanctions,” said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	She also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against “deceptive” Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	The Iranian government “uses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks” as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran’s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, Ms. Mandelker said.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	propaganda	She issued the warnings in a speech at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank as Iran announced Tuesday that it was formally moving ahead with preparations to increase its nuclear enrichment capacities — the sharpest response to date by the Islamic republic to Mr. Trump’s pullout from the nuclear accord.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	Iranian officials said the increase, while provocative, does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	propaganda	The president sent shock waves around the world with his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact and begin reimposing U.S. sanctions, which the U.S., Europe, China and Russia had collectively lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran’s promise to curb its suspect nuclear programs and allow international inspections.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	propaganda	While Iran told the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on Tuesday that it plans only to increase enrichment within limits set by 2015 deal, the announcement came with threats from a top Iranian official that the activities could be quickly expanded.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	propaganda	The warning put fresh pressure on European leaders to keep the nuclear accord alive despite Mr. Trump’s withdrawal.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	propaganda	The head of Iran’s nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, said Tehran is prepared to dramatically increase its capacity for enrichment but that the work so far is limited to building a facility for assembling the centrifuges.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	He made the comment a day after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	The Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama’s team was willing to go to ensure the deal’s success as it was still being negotiated.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	The Senate Homeland Security Committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks, facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	“Senior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,” according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	“Despite these claims, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the U.S. State Department, granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	“Even after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system,” the report said.

762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel’s findings Wednesday.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	Under terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained “illegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.”
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	The ban included any “intermediary” transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran — a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	On the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015, Tehran had some $5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to Senate investigators, who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	On Tehran’s request, Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department’s office of foreign assets control.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	According to the Senate report: “Muscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	[But] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars.”
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would “continue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market” under the proposed accord, but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	“On February 24, 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system,” according to the Senate report, which claims the move was made “even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.”
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	Even as office of foreign assets control officials directly “encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds,” the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction, said the report, which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, that contended the Obama “administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system.”
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	The catch, according to Senate investigators, was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange — in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	Despite the Obama administration’s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system, the Senate investigators said.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	propaganda	Mr. Portman said in a statement Tuesday night that “the Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran.”
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	“Despite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits, the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system,” Mr. Portman said.
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	“The only reason this transaction wasn’t executed was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the administration asked them to help convert the money.”
762147609	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall	non-propaganda	Such sanctions, he added, “are a vital foreign policy tool, and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness.”

788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	non-propaganda	President Trump’s sweeping order this week directing intelligence agencies to declassify documents from the more than 18-month-old investigation related to the Left’s electoral collusion conspiracy theory involving Trump and Russia may shed light on what really happened in the 2016 election.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	In an interview with Hill.TV yesterday, the president said he ordered the mass declassification to show the public that the FBI investigation of the conspiracy theory began as a “hoax.” Exposing it could be one of the “crowning achievements” of his presidency, he said.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	“What we’ve done is a great service to the country, really,” he said.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	“I hope to be able to call this, along with tax cuts and regulation and all the things I’ve done… in its own way this might be the most important thing because this was corrupt.”
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	non-propaganda	Trump criticized how the FBI handled the Russia probe, accusing it of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, and of spying on his campaign.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	“They know this is one of the great scandals in the history of our country because basically what they did is, they used [former Trump campaign aide] Carter Page, who nobody even knew, who I feel very badly for, I think he’s been treated very badly.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	They used Carter Page as a foil in order to surveil a candidate for the presidency of the United States.”
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	“It’s a hoax, beyond a witch hunt,” Trump said.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	The documents affected involve a FISA warrant against Carter Page and text messages from disgraced ex-FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	non-propaganda	(Carter Page is not related to Lisa Page.)
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	Although the conspiracy theory is baseless nonsense, it continues to dog the Trump administration, providing cable television news outlets and late-night talk show hosts with endless fodder in the 24-hour news cycle.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	When Trump defenders have fought back, social media companies have colluded with the Left to silence and intimidate them.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	non-propaganda	This declassification effort won’t make things any worse than they are for President Trump.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	It may even prove a political masterstroke of sorts for Trump.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	How else does one fight back against the nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State who hide behind anonymity to undermine the duly elected 45th president of the United States?
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	Make the documents public and let the chips fall where they may.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	There is so much leftist dirt to uncover.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	For example, it was established some time ago that former President Obama was involved on some level in this shameful un-American plot to rig the 2016 election and undermine his successor by using the privacy-invading apparatus of the state.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	non-propaganda	Obama wanted “to know everything” the FBI was doing in its investigation into claims that Russia was interfering in the 2016 election.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	Specifically, the statement that Obama wanted “to know everything we’re doing” came in a private Sept. 2, 2016, text message from FBI lawyer Lisa Page to FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she was having an extramarital affair at the time.
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	non-propaganda	"(The exact message, time-stamped 1:50 p.m., reads ""Yes, bc potus wants to know everything we are doing."")"
788173482	Exposing the Deep State Plotters	propaganda	In a separate text message to Page, Strzok wrote something cryptic about an “insurance policy” in case Donald Trump got elected.

7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	British politician Nigel Farage once helped convince Britons to vote for Brexit and separate from the European Union, but British establishment politicians have done everything they could to sabotage that vote since then.
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	Now Farage has apparently decided that if he can’t beat them, he’ll join them — if not on Brexit, then in their stance of denial and appeasement regarding the global jihad threat.’
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	At a recent dinner of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which he formerly headed, Farage said: “If dealing with Islamic fundamentalism becomes a battle between us and the entire religion, I’ll tell you the result: we’ll lose.
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	We will simply lose….We absolutely have to get that Muslim majority living in many of our towns and cities on our side, more attuned to Western values than some pretty hardline interpretations of the Qur’an.”
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	non-propaganda	Sure.
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	non-propaganda	Now how does Farage propose to do that?
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	His warning against making the resistance to jihad a “battle between us and the entire religion” is odd.
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	No sane person is saying that the West should go to war with the entire Islamic world.
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	The likeliest interpretation of his statement is that he is saying that we must not speak about how jihadis find justification for their actions in the Qur’an and Sunnah, as that will alienate the “moderates.”

7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	It must be exacted from him directly in order to vilify and humiliate him, so that Islam and its people may be exalted and the race of infidels brought low.
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	The jizya is to be imposed on all of them in full, without exception.
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	non-propaganda	Underlying this subjugation is a deep contempt for non-Muslims.
7651970399	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam	propaganda	In the year 718, the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz sent out a message to the governors of the various Islamic provinces:

729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	In what is being considered a particularly rare event, scientists are projecting that the Sun will be an unusually cool customer by the year 2050.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	By combining data and observations from decades of Sun research, experts are predicting a “Grand Solar Minimum” will occur a few decades from now, making our parent star dimmer and cooler than it has been for a very long time.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	The Sun might look the same to you today as it has since the first time you laid eyes on it, but our star actually displays plenty of changes.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	The Sun goes through regular cycles of solar minimums and solar maximums, which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm (the minimum) or incredibly active (the maximum).
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	These patterns repeat every 11 years or so, but new research suggests that there’s a pattern behind the pattern, and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	The study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	After combing the data, Lubin’s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum, making it a particularly calm moment for our star.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	During a solar minimum, the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots, and as a result, much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	This can have a number of effects on our planet, including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	Those changes can affect weather, though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	The grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum, and could produce some very noticeable effects.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	The most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	The event, called the Maunder Minimum, is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	non-propaganda	However, other parts of the planet heated up, including Alaska and Greenland, to far above their normal highs.
729581752	The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren’t worried	propaganda	This temporary shakeup of temperatures could happen again, though the researchers say it will have very little effect on the overall global warming trend that mankind has created for itself.

790777028	President Trump Orders FBI Investigation Into Kavanaugh Following Democrat Temper Tantrum	propaganda	Thought Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been through at least 6 FBI background checks, because of Senate Democrat temper tantrums and RINO Republican Senator Jeff Flake's desire to have another FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh with zero evidence, President Trump succumbed to the pressure and issued an executive order on Friday that authorizes another FBI background check into Kavanaugh.

790777028	President Trump Orders FBI Investigation Into Kavanaugh Following Democrat Temper Tantrum	propaganda	My guess is that one of two things will occur with the FBI investigation: (1) Absolutely nothing will be found, and this will have been a huge waste of time or (2) look for this thing to expand and the need will arise to make this more of a circus than it already is, which will dwarf anything Clarence Thomas had to face from the slanderous accusations of Anita Hill.

765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	'Textbook Definition of Bias'
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	On Monday, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified with FBI boss Christopher Wray before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	In a predictable performance, the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti-Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	On Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Oversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	The attorney general had been accused of “softening or watering down his report,” Gowdy said, “When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	propaganda	We see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding which DOJ policies to follow and which to ignore, to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support each and every element of an offense and we see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding whether to send a letter to Congress in the throes of looming election.”
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	propaganda	In a devastating exchange with Horowitz, Gowdy said that “prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it ends, and prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it begins” is the “textbook definition of bias.” Democrats echoed the IG report’s conclusion that there was no bias.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Republicans sought to tie up some loose threads.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	The IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Horowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Rep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	“I’ll have to get back to you on that,” Horowitz said, and the IG was “not sure” if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	If the IG did know the subject of the president’s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Horowitz “would have to ask” if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said “not the president himself.”
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	propaganda	Rep. King asked Horowitz about his first encounter with the switch of “extremely careless” for ‘gross negligence,” which violated a criminal statute.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Horowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	propaganda	The IG also said his team focused on the fact that the classified material on Clinton’s server was “not clearly marked,” which repeated one of Clinton’s claims about her negligence.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	As for the question of her “intent,” Horowitz said it arose “months earlier,” maybe in 2015, though he couldn’t be sure.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	King said President Obama had suggested the “careless but not intentional” language in a “60 Minutes” appearance in October of 2015.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	And King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used “intent” six times.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Horowitz said Comey “concealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.” The IG also described his report as a “thorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.”
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	The IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Horowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged “tens of thousands of texts.” Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about “we’ll stop” Trump.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Horowitz conceded that this meant “stop Trump from becoming president.” The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked “why did we not see it until last Thursday?”
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	“I can’t answer that,” Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein’s department at the DOJ.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Jordan concluded that Rosenstein “made the decision that we had to wait a month.”
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Several representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	“The FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,” Horowitz said.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Rep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	“They don’t work in counterintelligence,” said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG “false information” and altered key witness reports.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	“How did Comey see the report before it came out?” Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Horowitz said Comey didn’t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	By the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Horowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok’s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau’s Russia probe.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Also on Tuesday Peter Strzok was “escorted” from the FBI building.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	As his lawyer told reporters, Strzok had “played by the rules,” but been targeted by “unfounded personal attacks, political games and inappropriate information leaks.”
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	“I hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim,” Trey Gowdy told Fox News.
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	non-propaganda	Rep. Bob Goodlatte said the committee would issue a subpoena for Strzok to testify “next week.”
765953146	'Textbook Definition of Bias'	propaganda	That will make for an exciting show on C-SPAN but none of this would be happening if the deep state plot to “stop” Trump had succeeded.

706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	Newly released footage of the Las Vegas Massacre, captured by a private surveillance camera and recently released by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, has once again ignited the theory that helicopters were used during the horrific attack.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	Over the last month multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were and now, with this latest evidence release, that possibility seems all the more plausible.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	As Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub, “The [footage] is presumed to have been captured by a nearby business’s southward facing security camera which is located approximately 780 feet due east of the venue where the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was held on Oct. 1.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	The tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims.”
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	propaganda	Amazingly, the surveillance camera captured what seems to show a “large amount” of wind and debris being kicked up by a nearby helicopter hovering above the attack and or taking part in it.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	“Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 and 10:16 a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera,” Ambellas continued.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	“By 10:14 much larger crowds of people can be seen streaming through the area to escape the massacre going on,” Carlson reported.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	“You can see a large amount of wind and debris, apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead.”
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	The footage goes how to show two men attempt to help a victim who had apparently been shot, eventually resorting to covering up the body after they realized it was simply too late.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	Ambellas also reported on what his research indicates were documented helicopters in the air at the time.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	However, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	In fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	As I have reported in the past, multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used throughout the city.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	“Footage has emerged that may show muzzle flashes coming from the helicopter in what looks to be evidence that a team was firing into the crowd from the air on that fateful night,” read a report in The Daily Sheeple.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	propaganda	“Despite claims by some that these are “strobes” it remains unlikely that this is the case, especially when you consider other footage of the helicopter taken on the night as well as research by a group of investigators who believe the first attack on October 1st was carried out from the air.”
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	It is also important to keep in mind that there is footage of a still unidentified team loading up gear in a helicopter near the scene of the attack.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	propaganda	“In what can only be described as a “WTF video” the following footage seems to literally show a team of unknown soldiers gearing up next to a helicopter near the Route 91 concert.”
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	non-propaganda	Additionally, Carlson also noted during the initial broadcast of the private surveillance footage that the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI, who have so far never seen the footage, much less investigated it.
706636401	Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack	propaganda	While we may never know what actually happened during the Las Vegas Massacre, the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false and in fact nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a cover-up.

762152527	Spygate Coverup?	non-propaganda	Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) accuses the Republican House leadership of dragging their heels in the Spygate investigation.
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	non-propaganda	This has been evident for months now, as there are many connections and obvious questions that haven’t been investigated.
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	non-propaganda	The FBI files contain memos that need to be scoured too.
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	non-propaganda	The House leaders are Paul Ryan (Speaker of the House), Kevin McCarthy (Majority Leader), Steve Scalise (Majority Whip) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (House Republican Conference Chair).
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	non-propaganda	There is a decided lack of aggressiveness of this investigation.
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	propaganda	One source is Paul Ryan: Evidence: “House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy was ‘accurate’ when he argued the FBI has acted appropriately in its ongoing probe of potential Russian links to the Trump campaign.” How could Ryan possibly know this?
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	propaganda	Isn’t he prejudging the case without even finding out what actually happened?
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	non-propaganda	If Ryan is correct, an investigation will show it; but the current evidence suggests he is wrong.
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	propaganda	By short-circuiting the investigation, Ryan is betraying the interest of the American people to learn what the FBI and CIA actually did against Trump.
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	propaganda	Another Republican who wants to stop investigating is former RNC Chair, Michael Steele: “There is no Spygate because there are no spies in the campaign.” The attitude of Steve Scalise is wishy-washy.
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	propaganda	He’s open to a special prosecutor, but his responses come across as passive, lacking push, zeal and enthusiasm to delve deeply into Spygate.
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	non-propaganda	There is a kind of coverup at work here in which important Republicans do not want to bolster Trump by adding substance to Spygate, and they do not want to clean up the FBI by aggressively investigating Spygate further.
762152527	Spygate Coverup?	propaganda	They don’t want the rotten inner workings of the organization to be aired publicly.

758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	This is an outrage, but it is common nationwide: the Daily Caller News Foundation reports that Mountain Ridge Middle School in West Virginia is “instructing junior high students to write the Islamic profession of faith ostensibly to practice calligraphy.” Students are made to write out the Shahada, which states: “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.”This is exactly what I warned about in my book, Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance , in the chapter “The Mosqueing of the Public Schools.”In order to convert to Islam, one says the shahada.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	Saying the shahada makes you a Muslim.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	The shahada is what is on the black flag of jihad.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	No non-Muslim student should be forced to write or say the shahada without the qualifier “Muslims believe that…” This is because it is a statement of faith.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	If the school exercise is requiring students to write it, it should be clear from the wording of the exercise that this is Islamic faith, not the student’s faith.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	That distinction has been glossed over in many, many school textbook presentations.

758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Rich Penkoski, the father of a Mountain Ridge student, contacted me and explained the situation further.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	He sent me the packets the school gave out for the Jewish and the Christian lessons and commented:
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Notice no bible verses, no reciting the 10 commandments or the Lord’s prayer.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	No practicing writing in Hebrew (not even the 10 commandments) as compared to the Islamic packet.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	There are no statements of faith, nothing asking the students to write it or practice in any of the Jewish or Christian rituals.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Furthermore the principal of Mountain Ridge Middle School Dr.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Branch has used my words against me by saying the teacher did tell the students about the Lord’s prayer (my daughter as well as 1 other said this is false)[.]
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	He is using my arguments I made to him yesterday to protect the teacher.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	The teacher today told the students the assignment was optional.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	My daughter as well as other students were under the impression all the packet assignments were mandatory (the Jewish one and the Christian ones were mandatory).
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	I wrote to Dr.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Branch to share with him the resource that Miss Hinson used and point out that the material she gave the students did not include all the faith aspects for Christianity.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	The students received 2 pages for Christianity from this resource while all the Islamic sections were left intact.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Here’s the link for you to review.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	You will notice all the faith elements were left out for Judaism and Christianity while the Islamic section was left the way it’s presented.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/610/World%20Religions.pdf So she decided to use the extra resources for Islam and the school is saying that’s not indoctrination or proselytizing?
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	The faith aspects and the same considerations were not given to the others as they were for Islam.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	This actually further proves my point that Islam was afforded special privilege over the others.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	The school is backtracking and being deceptive to try and weasel out of this.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	The teacher today clarified things for the students but that still does not excuse the fact that they are teaching the Islamic faith and asking the kids to participate in Sharia.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Look at the Islamic packet again.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	They are asking the kids to write the beginning of Surahs.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	The teacher still has not corrected the error that calligraphy was started by the arabs.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	They are doubling down and only after being called on it are they trying to backtrack.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	Rich Penkoski is hardly the first to protest this egregious submission to the most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	In Volusia County, Florida, hundreds protested Islamic lessons in their “World History” text, a Common Core-approved high school history textbook.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	With an entire chapter dedicated to the virtues of Islam and not a single chapter for Christianity, the textbook had Floridians in a frenzy.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	And who is the biggest pusher of Common Core besides leftist progressives?
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	The Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim Brotherhood front group, along with the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	In Florida, CAIR is on the offensive (more here).
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	We have seen the increasing Islamization of the public-school curriculum.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	History lessons in Islam are dawah – proselytizing for Islam.

758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	In West Virginia, it gets even worse.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	Rich Penkoski has alerted me to the latest development in the forced Islamization of his children’s school curriculum: after the Daily Caller and Geller Report exposed what was happening, Mountain Ridge administrators and teachers began messaging parents who were sharing the story, asking them to remove their posts.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	What do they have to hide?
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Apparently, a great deal.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	Worse still, Penkoski is now being threatened by students who attend the school with his daughter.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	(And who is behind them?
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Unidentified “adult friends.”)
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	He sent this message to me:
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	A student in the school threatened to get her adult friends to come to my home and kill me by stabbing me in the chest and ripping my organs out.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	They told my daughter “we are gonna get some people and kill your dad.” This student, who is known to me but whom I cannot name because she is a minor, has given students our address and is encouraging them to come to my home over this whole thing.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	Another student told my daughter that she and the first student and her adult friends are going to kill me and carve a satanic star in my chest and rip out my organs.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	They then threatened to hang my 3-year-old and 1-year-old and kidnap my 14-year-old.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	All this in school today because of the articles.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	This is not a joke and needs to be investigated.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	I have contacted the school’s principal, Dr.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	non-propaganda	Branch, and I trust that he will take this matter seriously and deal with it appropriately.
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	Is the principal acting on this?
758756657	Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia	propaganda	And do the police have any interest in this?

729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Hey, remember five minutes ago when Pope Francis shouted at a reporter in Chile that there was “no evidence” supporting complaints against his good friend Bishop Juan Barros?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	And, just for good measure he accused the people accusing him – victims of sexual abuse by Barros’ mentor, the convicted sex-predator Karadima – of committing “calumny”?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	[1] And remember when Cardinal O’Malley told the pope off in public over the “pain” these accusations had caused the victims of sexual abuse?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	And then remember how the pope had apologised-except-not-really because the accusations are, after all, still lies, and that there’s still “no evidence” against Barros…?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros’ complicity in Karadima’s sexual abuse – not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Nicole Winfield and the Associated Press dropped the bomb that the information came directly from the victims, whom Francis had dismissed and refused to meet with on his trip, and delivered through his own Commission on sexual abuse:
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Pope Francis received a victim’s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter’s author and members of Francis’ own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has “zero tolerance” for sex abuse and cover-ups.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	It also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors, compounding the most serious crisis of his five-year papacy.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Now it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, “had already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	“But with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to…Osorno.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	While the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	When, after several attempts and three months later[2], Muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason, he received the response, “I am the pope, I do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	I have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Marco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Without naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates:
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	“It was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The nuncio has prepared the triad [the “terna” or list of three candidates].
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	A cardinal, head of the dicastery, perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops, during the ordinary assembly took the floor, saying: ‘The first candidate indicated is excellent, the second is good.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	But I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	He responds little to the necessary criteria.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	But the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.’ The meeting ended without further decisions.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Whatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Bergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Even while “apologising” the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, “You, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven’t seen any, because they haven’t come forward.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	“In the case of Barros it’s been observed, it’s been studied; there’s no evidence.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The best thing to do if someone believes it’s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O’Malley, the pope’s “top abuse advisor,” with the letter to deliver to the pope.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Marie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican’s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, “When we gave him [O’Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.” Juan Carlos Cruz, the Karadima victim whose membership on the Commission the Vatican had blocked, told AP, “Cardinal O’Malley called me after the pope’s visit here in Philadelphia and he told me, among other things, that he had given the letter to the pope – in his hands.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	On the face of it, there are only a few logical possibilities here.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	In fact, unless Cardinal O’Malley – who has, as of this writing, remained silent – comes forward and says that he didn’t hand the letter over pope, there is really only one; that the pope lied.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	And this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	As Winfield writes,
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	“The revelation could be costly for Francis, whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5].
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	More recently, he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Vatican analysts now openly question whether he ‘gets it,’ and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn’t.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	“No evidence…” Lie big, lie often, and when caught, keep lying.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	One of the many things these secular reporters seem not to be paying attention to is that “no evidence” is in fact a well-rehearsed, stock response for Bergoglio.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	He said almost exactly the same in 2013 when confronted about another predatory homosexual he was sheltering.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	The hoopla surrounding the “Who am I to judge” comment tends to obscure the context of the comment.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	It was made in response to a question by a journalist about Monsignore Battista Ricca – a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the Telegraph as early as July 2013.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Ilze Scamparini asked the pope about Ricca, saying, “What you intend to do about this?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	How are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby?”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	What reply did Bergoglio give?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	His standard one: “No evidence.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	About Monsignor Ricca: I did what canon law calls for, that is a preliminary investigation.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	And from this investigation, there was nothing of what had been alleged.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	We did not find anything of that.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	This is the response.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	He added, “In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	But Ricca’s activities, for which the pope claimed there was no evidence, were notorious.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	They include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute, and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	So flagrant was Ricca’s behaviour that it took intervention by Uruguay’s nuncio to have him removed.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	It was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L’Espresso, who said the information was confirmed by “numerous bishops, priests, religious and laity” in Uruguay[6].
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	In fact, the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio’s normal procedures.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	As “Marcantonio Colonna” wrote in the Dictator Pope, “In fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	It was at this early “no evidence” comment on the plane home from Rio that some of those paying attention started to understand that Bergoglio’s policy is in line with that of certain leaders of the past who recommended that if a politician was going to lie, he should lie big and lie brazenly.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	And in case anyone was wondering what will happen next, the same advice said to keep on lying after you’re caught.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The pattern of silence and, when pressed, flat-out denial has been Bergoglio’s policy since long before he came on the international scene.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	He has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement, and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Perhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Indeed, on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people, it could only be measured in the negative numbers.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	“Argentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis…”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Though the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti-clerical, their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	On their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio/Francis simply isn’t interested in hearing from victims.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	“In Pope Francis’s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Wall Street Journal reports, including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops’ conference, he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	“All of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later,” the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The site says that “in addition to Bergoglio’s failure to respond to victims, the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	In fact, he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Weeks after his election to the papacy, he was quoted by his close friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, “In my diocese it never happened to me, but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this.” Francis added that he agreed with the “zero tolerance” attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict’s reforms – most of which he was later to quietly reverse.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	It was at exactly this time, however, that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope’s attention.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	One, known to the press only as “Gabriel,” wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio César Grassi, accused of molesting at least five boys, “who has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Morón and the Court of Cassation.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	So far, judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	In case anyone thinks the Grassi-Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope’s attention, Bishop Accountability summarises, “A year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [2003] but before the start of Grassi’s trial, three men ransacked the survivor’s apartment and beat him.” These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Ten years [after Gabriel filed criminal charges], in May 2013, with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009, “Gabriel and his attorney, Juan Pablo Gallego, brought a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	An employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises.”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The group surmises that it was Bergoglio’s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	In 2006, then-Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a “media campaign” and claimed that the Grassi case was “different” from other accusations.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	During his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio “never let go” of his hand.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	In 2009, Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of “Gabriel,” who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse, but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Several more similar cases, all of whom were rebuffed in their attempts to meet with Bergoglio, are detailed here, for the strong-of-stomach.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	A virtuoso performance-liar
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Looking back and carefully examining his record, Jorge Bergoglio’s mastery of using the weaknesses of morally compromised men is becoming evident.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	It is arguable that even the members of the so-called “San Gallen Mafia” who apparently conspired to put him on Peter’s throne were used by him.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	But he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Looking carefully at the infamous “Who am I to judge” comment, this was clear early on.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	The first part of that interview is a blatant and enormous lie, and it was from there that the pope moved on to his apology for homosexuality in general.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Recall that this was the very first airplane interview, on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio, a matter of weeks after his election.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	At the time, the papal apologists sprang instantly into action and we heard all about how the pope was talking strictly within the boundaries of Catholic doctrine.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	But perhaps in hindsight, we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech, one that was clearly well-rehearsed.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	(Don’t forget, no question is asked in a papal interview without being thoroughly vetted ahead of time.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Journalists must submit their questions well in advance.)
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	This was the pope laying out his policy regarding homosexuality, a policy for which he was duly rewarded by being lauded on the cover of the homosexualist lobby’s US trade magazine.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Read his full answer carefully:
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	I see that many times in the Church, over and above this case, but including this case, people search for “sins from youth”, for example, and then publish them.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	They are not crimes, right?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Crimes are something different: the abuse of minors is a crime.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	No, sins.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	But if a person, whether it be a lay person, a priest or a religious sister, commits a sin and then converts, the Lord forgives, and when the Lord forgives, the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	When we confess our sins and we truly say, “I have sinned in this”, the Lord forgets, and so we have no right not to forget, because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	That is a danger.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	This is important: a theology of sin.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Many times I think of Saint Peter.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	He committed one of the worst sins, that is he denied Christ, and even with this sin they made him Pope.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	We have to think a great deal about that.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	But, returning to your question more concretely.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	This is the first question.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Then, you spoke about the gay lobby.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	So much is written about the gay lobby.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	I still haven’t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with “gay” on it.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	They say there are some there.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	I believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	This one is not good.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: “no one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society”.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	The problem is in making a lobby of this tendency: a lobby of misers, a lobby of politicians, a lobby of masons, so many lobbies.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	For me, this is the greater problem.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Thank you so much for asking this question.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Many thanks.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	One of the pope’s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	He starts by assuming, without any effort at defence or explanation, a point that concedes the whole issue.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	This was the first time a pope had ever used the political term “gay”.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Not “homosexual,” not “same-sex attracted,” but “gay,” meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement’s linguistic manipulations.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Language counts in politics, and a pope using that term means he is by implication starting the discussion – and his pontificate – by aligning himself with the basic tenets of a movement that is violently opposed to Catholic moral teaching, and in direct opposition to his immediate, and still living, predecessor.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	In this case too, he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves, or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to “disagree” with Catholic teaching on sexuality.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	There are very few “conservative” Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	This means that his use of this language was a conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience, a sly message to say, “People talk all the time about a gay lobby, but you and I both know this is mostly nonsense, propaganda from those people… those conservatives…We cool and hip people don’t hate gays, do we?”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	This astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity, an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	We are simply asked to take the pope’s word for it, but given that it follows his astoundingly brazen lie that there was no evidence for Ricca’s homosexual activity in the first place, we can take the assurance for what it seems to be worth.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Next, after another little inside nudge-nudge-wink-wink joke about the “gay lobby” – implying (but of course never outright saying) that the whole thing is hysterical nonsense – we hear a direct contradiction to Catholic teaching from no less a source than his predecessor, Pope Benedict Ratzinger.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	“The problem is not having this tendency.” Well, actually, your holiness, yes it is, particularly in the case of priests.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	The “tendency” is called in the same catechism you quote “intrinsically disordered” and Ratzinger was very clear that this “tendency” is a sign of a serious emotional dysfunction that “must” preclude a man from being ordained.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Squandering the capital of trust
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	A few months ago in a piece for the Remnant, I talked about why the Church (and nearly all human societies) regard lying as a sin:
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	A mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	But Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Lying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Thomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil, and most unlike God, because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Habitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being, one that is by nature an opponent of Truth, ordered against Truth.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	This of course means that a person whose “orientation,” as we might say, is towards falsehood, even when he is at any given moment saying something true, is still servicing his lies.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	He tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	It was not by violence, but by lying and manipulation, by issuing half-truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not, that Shakespeare’s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Human beings are naturally ordered towards the truth, and we have to work at assuming a lie.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	This is why confidence tricksters can be successful, why lying works for getting what you want; people don’t see it coming.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The first natural assumption is trust, at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	We therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Considering how much trust the Catholic faithful had in the papacy until about 1965, how much un-earned trust Francis started with just by being elected, this pontificate should be remembered as one of the great confidence scams in history.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Believing Catholics have watched aghast as this pope has habitually trampled on every aspect of Catholic teaching.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Sandro Magister recently published a piece on his website that listed in dizzying detail the many times, in only the last few months, that pope Francis has falsified with obvious intention, the words of Christ in Scripture and the teaching of the Church.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Of course this would be of little interest to secular journalists, who have paid no mind to his habit of rewriting Catholicism, but the sex abuse crisis is something secular journalists are very interested in, a fact Bergoglio seems not to have understood.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	It is now irrefutable that Pope Bergoglio is a habitual liar – that in fact truth, like reality, seems to mean nothing to him except as a tool.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Sociologists talk about the concept of the “high trust society,” one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	They warn that the general loss of trust in institutions leads to a general state of chaos, in which laws on the books matter little as citizens turn to their last resort of protecting themselves and their own families.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	This is the way societies disintegrate.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	It has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful, and this is true.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	With a professional confidence trickster on the papal throne, blatantly using lies and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with Catholic doctrine, how long before that predictable disintegration occurs?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Are we seeing it already?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Are we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on Amoris Laetitia and Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	With Cardinal Marx and others promoting “blessings” for “same-sex unions” are we going to be seeing an escalation of it?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	I have seen a veritable chorus of Catholics on social media declaring that if Paul VI is canonised, their loss of faith in the Church as an institution will be complete.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	I am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio’s support has completely dried up.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	He has no more resources of trust even among the people he has chosen to surround himself with and after the reports of Cardinal Sandri going toe-to-toe with him in a shouting match, it seems that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrums are failing to have the desired effect of terrorising his subordinates into submission.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Marie Collins, by no stretch even a “conservative” Catholic, echoed this concern, saying the Barros affair has “definitely undermined credibility, trust, and hope” in Francis.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	“All I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope, and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish, would find it very difficult now…and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks,” she told the National Catholic Reporter.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	It may seem like a moment to enjoy, seeing the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally cracking, but in reality this situation is potentially very harmful for souls in the long run.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	There is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone, but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	Already fractured since the collapse of all Catholic institutions after Vatican II and the horrors of the sex abuse crisis, how much will there be to repair of the once-steadfast trust Catholics instinctively had in the Church after this?
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Notes:
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	[1] “Not one victim has come forward in Chile; show me the proof.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	This is slander and calumny.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Is that clear?”
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	[2] The book “The Dictator Pope” relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high-ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope, whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	It is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves, which may be the reason Cardinal Zen, in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	[3] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world… and drives the rest of us spare.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	Italians care about getting a general picture of what’s going on, where Anglo-Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	[4] Though she never blamed the pope, Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission’s recommendations.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	The time limit of the Commission’s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	non-propaganda	[5] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest – now laicised – approached some of the pope’s close advisors for help, including Cardinal Coccopalmerio.
729578579	SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case	propaganda	[6] Not that anyone in Rome was trying very hard.

762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	propaganda	Awan told people Wasserman Schultz chose the name for his daughter, Leza — a Jewish name — and that the Florida congresswoman’s daughter regularly rode a horse that Awan kept at a boarding facility, sources with knowledge of the relationship told TheDCNF.

762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	propaganda	A 2009 article in the Pakistani publication Dawn, headlined “Influential expat shields father from long arm of law,” said Awan’s father was facing criminal fraud charges involving a land deal, but Awan used political connections to pressure the police into targeting the alleged victims instead.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Awan’s father purchased “huge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,” but all the checks bounced, the report said.

762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	But Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on “websites” and “printers,” which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	The congresswoman also added Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Wasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 — 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	propaganda	Her actions so rattled the Administration Committee’s Democratic staff director, Jamie Fleet, that he planted a negative story in Politico that revealed Wasserman Schultz, his fellow Democrat, was continuing to pay the suspect, two House sources said.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	The story also said Wasserman Schultz had a “friendly personal relationship” with Awan and Alvi.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Fleet did not respond to a request for comment.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	propaganda	Kiko said in an April 2018 hearing spurred by the scandal that he was powerless to stop members who refused to fire a bad actor.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	“Termination, now it’s the member’s responsibility … We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,” he said.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	propaganda	He added that his office should have the authority to override members who would want to keep a rule-breaker on the government network.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Wasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	House investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Yet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, “my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.”
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	propaganda	Wasserman Schultz was defending someone investigators allegedly told her was suspected of cybersecurity violations, despite having resigned from her position as DNC head following a devastating hack during the 2016 election.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Despite Wasserman Schultz’s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 — two months after he was banned from the computer network — the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Capitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan’s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said “attorney client privilege,” according to a police report.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Awan’s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	That led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with “consequences” for not returning the laptop.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	When he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police’s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	propaganda	House sources told TheDCNF these exchanges were only a public glimpse into numerous such interactions, which were frequently profane, with every official she could buttonhole.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	propaganda	One source said she also went to the Department of Justice and “made a stink.”
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Wasserman Schultz hired the House’s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard — who had recently quit the House — to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported.Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami — one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton.

762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	One of Awan’s lawyers told a judge he felt “very strongly” that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Prosecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	In August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Prosecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret.
762206044	Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan	non-propaganda	Capitol Police “requested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn’t want to tip off the employees,” she said.

788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	The Left’s continuing success in delaying a confirmation vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court reveals its malicious agenda to block the nominee from sitting on the high court when its new term begins Monday, October 1.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	Democrats had Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s never-credible accusations of sexual abuse -- including possible attempted rape -- in hand way back in the summer.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	They deliberately refused to bring up the allegations, as weak and ridiculous as they are, at Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearings because they didn’t want to have a rational discussion.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	They wanted to hurl the wild claims like a grenade at the last minute to blow up the process.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	And so far it appears they’re succeeding.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	If Kavanaugh isn’t in place a week from Monday, the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have only been eight justices in place.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to take control from Republicans.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Election Day is November 6.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Christine Blasey Ford’s lawyers are trying to game the system.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	They know that Senate Judiciary Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to provide a full week’s notice for a hearing.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	So, if, for example, the committee followed the rules and agreed Friday (today) to a hearing, the soonest it could be held would be next Friday, the final business day before the Supreme Court’s new term begins.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	Of course, lawyers are masters of delay, and social justice warrior-lawyers hoping to torpedo President Trump’s agenda have an added incentive to drag the confirmation process out as long as possible.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	New demands and fake emergencies are bound to arise from Ford’s legal team.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	It was unclear at press time if the public hearing scheduled for Monday into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh would go forward.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Kavanaugh informed the committee he was willing to testify Monday.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	"“I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,"" he wrote in a letter."
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	"Ford's lawyer Debra Katz told the Judiciary Committee her client ""wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety."""
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Another Ford attorney reportedly said Wednesday that there are “multiple witnesses” who need to testify.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	"""A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,” Katz wrote in a letter."
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	“Dr.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Ford has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.”
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	GOP lawmakers are figuring out how to respond to Ford’s request, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports:
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Late Thursday, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman, said that his staff had discussed the issue with Ford’s attorney earlier in the day and that he would consult with his fellow committee members about the next move.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Ford’s offer also increased the pressure on several key moderates — particularly GOP Sens.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — whose votes will probably be needed to put Kavanaugh on the high court.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	Both were already facing heavy pressure from abortion rights groups concerned that Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative and longtime GOP attorney, might vote to restrict access to abortion.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	The sexual assault allegation, which the nominee has denied, has upended his seemingly sure-bet confirmation and only increased the stakes for the key lawmakers.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Chairman Grassley had imposed a Thursday deadline for Ford to submit testimony after her team said Tuesday she wasn’t willing to testify until the FBI investigates her sexual abuse allegations against Kavanaugh.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	Left-wingers such as Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) echoed Ford’s demand.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	The demand for an FBI probe is “utter nonsense,” former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova said earlier this week.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Ford “really doesn’t want to testify,” he said.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	“Because when she does, she is going to look like the loon she is.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	She may very well believe everything she’s saying, and that is one of the signs of lunacy, believing something that isn’t real.” And her lawyer is “even loonier.”
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Besides, diGenova explained, the eleventh-hour sexual abuse claim leveled against Kavanaugh is a non-federal matter and in this case the alleged assault hasn’t even been clearly outlined by the alleged victim.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Ford didn’t report it to anyone for decades and isn’t even certain when or where it happened, so the FBI can’t investigate the matter “because there is nothing to investigate.”
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	Kavanaugh has already undergone six FBI background checks and the agency has ruled out investigating Ford’s allegation of drunken groping at a teenagers’ party 36 years ago.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	Ford’s request for an FBI probe is “clearly a desire to delay proceedings,” diGenova said.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	President Trump is taking the high road and is avoiding attacking Ford, which isn’t a risky move given how obviously unbalanced the accuser is.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	Ford is already doing an excellent job destroying herself without Republican assistance.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	"At the White House on Wednesday, President Trump said it would be ""wonderful"" if Ford testifies and ""unfortunate"" if she does not."
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	"He indicated he was keeping an open mind about the allegations but that it was ""very hard for me to imagine anything happened"" between her and the nominee."
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	"""I think he's an extraordinary man – I think he's a man of great intellect, as I've been telling you, and he has an unblemished record,"" Trump said."
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	"""This is a very tough thing for him and his family and we want to get over it but at the same time we want to give tremendous amounts of time."
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	"If she shows up that would be wonderful – if she doesn't show up that would be unfortunate."""
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	non-propaganda	CBS News reports that Judge Kavanaugh's wife, Ashley Kavanaugh, has received multiple threats.
788816478	Kavanaugh Battle Brews	propaganda	“The text of three emailed threats, obtained by CBS News, were obscene and violent in nature.

776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	However, over the past 54 years, a deluge of information and government officials have come forward showing that most everything the government and the media told Americans about the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	propaganda	Often, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact — and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident — perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	propaganda	According to the widely discredited official story, on August 2, 1964, the destroyer USS Maddox, while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations, was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron.

776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	The next day, without question, on August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted then-President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by “communist aggression.” The resolution served as Johnson’s legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	propaganda	As a result, 58,177 Americans would lose their lives.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	propaganda	Additionally, over one million North and South Vietnamese, including 627,000 civilians would be slaughtered.

776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	propaganda	At all.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	propaganda	In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	propaganda	The truth of the matter was that the Maddox was engaged in an aggressive intelligence gathering operation working hand in hand in coordinated attacks on North Vietnam by the South Vietnamese navy and the Laotian air force.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	When the government announced that it had been the victim of an unprovoked attack—this was a lie.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	In the 2003 documentary The Fog of War , the former United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara admitted that the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened.

776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	Giáp claimed that the attack had been imaginary.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	In 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	Tom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam ,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did and over a million lives would’ve been saved.

776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	“Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	We should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotaged by fake news.”
776616374	54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War	non-propaganda	Indeed, as TFTP has reported at length, nearly all wars in US history have been started over false information.

731063195	One Trillion Stars	non-propaganda	In astronomy, a light-year is a commonly used unit to measure distance, but some astronomers prefer to use a unit called the parsec.
731063195	One Trillion Stars	non-propaganda	When referring to something larger, they use kiloparsecs, which are equal to 1,000 parsecs, and megaparsecs, equal to one million parsecs.

705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	The key passages (paragraph breaks added) rebuke Francis for his recklessness, his deliberate ambiguity, his fomenting of error, his sowing of disunity, his unheard-of calumnies of the faithful, and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology—precisely the wrong of which he accuses orthodox Catholics:
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	propaganda	Your Holiness, a chronic confusion seems to mark your pontificate….
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	This fosters within the faithful a growing unease ….
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	"In ""Amoris Laetitia,"" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous, thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching…."
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	propaganda	To teach with such a seemingly intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	The Holy Spirit is given to the Church, and particularly to yourself, to dispel error, not to foster it.
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	propaganda	"[Y]ou seem to censor and even mock those who interpret Chapter 8 of ""Amoris Laetitia"" in accord with Church tradition as Pharisaic stone-throwers who embody a merciless rigorism."

705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	Again and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish, and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life.
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	Your critics have been accused, in your own words, of making doctrine an ideology.
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	But it is precisely Christian doctrine… that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic, life-giving Gospel.

705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	separate themselves from Jesus, the author of truth… What they [i.e., Francis] then possess, and can only possess, is an ideology – one that conforms to the world of sin and death.
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	[F]aithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops, men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them.
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	What scandalizes believers, and even some fellow bishops, is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church, but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice….
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	"As a result, many of the faithful, who embody the ""sensus fidelium,"" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd."

705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	You have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church.
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	You have frequently encouraged… all persons, especially bishops, to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think.
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	But… what many [bishops] have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it… Many fear that if they speak their mind, they will be marginalized or worse.

705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	Father Weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven.
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	As he recounts here, after repeatedly “beseeching Jesus and Mary, St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today, a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused,” he asked for a minutely specific sign from heaven on whether he should write the letter: that the next day he would meet someone he had not seen in a very long time, would never expect to see in Rome, and was not from the United States, Canada or Great Britain, which person would utter the particular phrase: “Keep up the good writing.”
705409419	﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate	non-propaganda	At lunch the next day, the sign was given.

762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	Homeschooling rates are skyrocketing as parents are continually getting more and more upset at the leftist social engineering taking place in public schools.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	The indoctrination is getting so bad, that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	non-propaganda	According to The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Florida, was the last straw for scores of parents.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	non-propaganda	The paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	“When the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,” said coalition president Tim Lambert.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	non-propaganda	“In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	We’re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.” But according to Natural News, it isn’t just the rampant violence worrying some parents.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	non-propaganda	That’s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	Christopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with “the violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.” Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering, which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	For example, a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study ‘white privilege’.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	non-propaganda	The left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools.

Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who’s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	non-propaganda	Ray said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	Since teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones, homeschooling takes care of that problem.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	non-propaganda	“Most parents homeschool for more than one reason,” Ray told the paper.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	“But when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	non-propaganda	It includes all of that.”
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	Indoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	propaganda	It’s the very reason the governments of the world still exist.
762546428	Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence	non-propaganda	People cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong – even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it.

732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	non-propaganda	The Vatican has said it “worked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.”
732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	non-propaganda	What didn’t it do?
732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	non-propaganda	Commission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists.
732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	non-propaganda	Even if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests’ behavior, those strictures were not enough, O’Malley said in 2014.

732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	propaganda	The commission was behind Francis’ decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests, and to fund it for five years.
732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	non-propaganda	But amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground.

732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	propaganda	Commission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests, rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to “park” the priest out of harm’s way.

732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	non-propaganda	Possibly not.

732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	propaganda	The pope has stuck by Barros, dismissing the protesters as “lefties” and hugging Barros publicly during his visit to Chile last month.
732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	non-propaganda	"""I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence,"" he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz."

732708002	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot	non-propaganda	Vatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission.

789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	propaganda	Two more women accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of dubious improprieties materialized out of thin air late Sunday, throwing Senate Republicans’ hope of finally confirming the Supreme Court nominee this week even more into doubt.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	The new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	propaganda	Suspiciously, Ford can’t –or won’t— say when or where the alleged incident happened and can provide few details.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	propaganda	As Paul Sperry writes at the New York Post, working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and backed financially by George Soros’s money, Ford’s lawyers spent the last few days gaming the system.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	After stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions, the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands, such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence.

789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	“The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	propaganda	This is a smear, plain and simple.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name — and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building — against these last-minute allegations.”
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	If Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench on October 1, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have only been only eight justices in place.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans.

789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Meanwhile, the New Yorker magazine reported Sunday that Deborah Ramirez, 53, suddenly claims to have been assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Ramirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	propaganda	Also on Sunday, media-savvy sleazeball lawyer Michael Avenatti, who represents porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he represents another woman who plans to accuse Kavanaugh of something.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	“I represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	We will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify,” Avenatti wrote on Twitter.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	“My client is not Deborah Ramirez.”
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	Washington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed, or at least they did before the two new accusers popped up.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	For example, at a Friday afternoon preview of upcoming cases in the Supreme Court’s approaching October term that was hosted by the Federalist Society, panelist Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell predicted that the high court would have nine members again soon.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	propaganda	“There is exactly a zero percent chance that [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley will allow this thing to get past the lame-duck” congressional session after Election Day, said the co-founder of SCOTUSblog who has appeared before the Supreme Court many times.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	“I think we ought to recognize that.
789370998	The Left’s Show Trial for Kavanaugh	non-propaganda	The prospect that the Democrats will take the Senate, albeit thin, is realistic, and so they will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that there is a ninth member of the court there by the time a Democratic majority could take over in the Senate in January.”

778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit):
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Every time Mass is celebrated, the priest prays that Jesus will “look not on our sins but on the faith of [his] Church… .” That’s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese, well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	I’ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face-to-face with its sins, with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century, has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	To make matters worse (if that is even possible), evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop, as well as some priests and laity, had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail: Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless “promoted” to become the archbishop in our nation’s capital, and elevated to the College of Cardinals.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	While I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there’s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don’t, I don’t think that the Church in the United States will rest — and confidence will be restored — until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn’t happen again.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	A number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	When serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press).
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	By the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Years before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read — as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer — an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	While the complaint didn’t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Knowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	I can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	I heard lots of gut-wrenching stories in my two-and-a-half years there, but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	With St. John Paul II’s 1995 visit, he was remembered for “bringing a saint to Newark,” not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	When I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.

778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	The events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law, regardless of rank or privilege.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Our heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that “where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	"REMNANT COMMENT: While we certainly appreciate His Excellency's candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church, we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church's official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so-called ""gay lifestyle,"" which includes her long-held teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime."
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	"Far from being reassured of this by their bishops, many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an ""inclusive community"" that ""welcomes all"" and ""judges none."""
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	All very well and good, except for the fact that the Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	In fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	"Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered."""
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	They are contrary to the natural law.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	They close the sexual act to the gift of life.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Under no circumstances can they be approved.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	(Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Under no circumstances…except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ-friendly or not.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	"Even Pope John Paul ""The GREAT's"" Vatican clarified the Church's teaching on October 31, 1986, in the “Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons”:"
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	It is not.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Notice the late pope does not say, “Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Does Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn't care about her or the moral code by which she governs?
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Does he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics?
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	"Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our ""Catholic Christian"" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?"
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Pope John Paul certainly didn't accept that.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	In his 2005 book Memory and Identity, John Paul referred to homosexuality as an “ideology of evil,” insisting of so-called 'gay marriage' that:
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	“It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man.”
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Was Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe?
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Are Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	Or is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the Church's own infallible teaching, everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration?
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	And if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals, then we call FOUL even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	We're all sinners, of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are, just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	So why are our bishops playing dumb?
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Quite obviously, it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning--and sinning proudly.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	This is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about!
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	"But, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of ""accompaniment"" is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests."
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	So what's going on here?
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Who are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	"Is it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the ""gay lifestyle"" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance?"
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	"The Catholic Church's new-found ""climate of tolerance"" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!"
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	It is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this, and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	This is gross dereliction of duty, and we hope and pray that all the good U.S. bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the Church's clear teaching against all sins of the flesh, homo- and heterosexual.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	Again, God bless Archbishop Hebda for this welcome statement, and may God grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it’s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that’s going on here.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Our bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	And neither can God's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our “most enlightened” age---which is, of course, an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	non-propaganda	Until the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy.
778664280	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal	propaganda	McCarrick will become the norm, not the exception, and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the Catholic Church will remain in the toilet indefinitely... exactly as the forces of darkness intended all along.

730149656	Muslim Crime Stopper Sofian Zakkout's New Crush: Anti-Semite Pastor Steve Anderson	propaganda	About the clip, on Facebook, Zakkout wrote above it, “Makes a lot of sense!” Of course, this is coming from someone [Zakkout] who regularly refers to Jews as “monkeys and pigs,” and in February 2016, circulated on social media a report claiming that “the Holocaust was faked.” The report calls the Holocaust “the biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity” and was produced by a media outlet which describes Hitler as “the greatest leader in modern Western history.”

730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	BRATISLAVA, Slovakia, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Former Vatican doctrine chief Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller has decried the Church's current adaptation to the modern world and rejected the idea of blessing homosexual couples.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	The remarks, made in a February 6 talk in Slovakia, indirectly respond to new initiatives coming from Germany, especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	Cardinal Müller, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, spoke at a conference on John Paul II's encyclical Veritatis Splendor at the Comenius University in Bratislava, organized by the Slovakian Bishops' Conference.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	propaganda	In remarks after his address, reported by the German Catholic newspaper Die Tagespost, the cardinal made it clear what he thinks about the recently presented German idea of blessing homosexual unions, even if only in individual cases: “If a priest blesses a homosexual couple, then this is an atrocity at a holy site, namely, to approve of something that God does not approve of.”
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	propaganda	According to the Tagespost report, Cardinal Müller said in his address that he regrets the separation of the Church's doctrinal and moral teaching and called Christianity a “theocentric humanism.” He said the “submissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this-worldly life conditions” is a “suicidal modernization” that denies mankind the Truth of God.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	In this context, the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	Morality, Müller explained, is rooted in Grace; that is why any teaching about “rules and exceptions” ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	In the discussion following his talk, Cardinal Müller also responded to questions concerning Pope Francis' post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	The cardinal said that he is “not happy” about the fact that there are different interpretations of this papal text by some bishops' conferences.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	propaganda	“In dogmatic questions, there cannot be a plurality,” he added.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	propaganda	There is only one Magisterium, he said, and bishops' conferences can only decide about pastoral questions.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	Contradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments, said the cardinal, lead into chaotic conditions.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	propaganda	Thus, explained the cardinal, the Sacraments have to be celebrated the way Christ Himself willed it when he instituted them.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	propaganda	The controversial eighth chapter of Amoris Laetitia has to be understood “in an orthodox way,” namely that “he who lives in the state of mortal sin cannot receive Holy Communion.” It is, in Müller's eyes, the pope's duty “to unite the Church, that is what the pope is there for.” This is what he, Müller, himself told the pope: when the bishops' conferences present different interpretations of Amoris Laetitia, the Church enters “into a situation like the one before the Reformation.”
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	Archbishop Stanislav Zvolensy, President of the Slovakian Bishops' Conference and archbishop of Bratislava, told Die Tagespost that Veritatis Splendor is not only still valid, but shows timeless truths.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	Promulgated 25 years ago, the encyclical rejects authoritatively the theory of situation ethics, a theory that seems to be getting again much attention in our time, for example by theologians such as Professor Maurizio Chiodi.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	non-propaganda	Professor Livio Melina, the former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family, was another speaker at the February 6 conference.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	propaganda	He stressed that Amoris Laetitia has to be “read in the context of the magisterial instructions of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor, which recalls the connection between conscience and truth, as well as the necessity of a well-formed conscience.” In returning to that encyclical, explained the Italian professor and theologian, Amoris Laetitia could be given a hermeneutic in light of a “continuity with the Magisterium of the Church.” He also said: “The Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us.
730573740	Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’	propaganda	If we fulfill them, we are united with God.”

757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	The city is a major transportation hub with routes to the capital Kinshasa.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	Forty-four people have been infected and 23 people are known to have died.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	propaganda	Senior World Health Organization (WHO) official Peter Salama said the spread to Mbandaka meant there was the potential for an “explosive increase” in cases.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	“This is a major development in the outbreak,” he told the BBC.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	“We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	propaganda	The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there.” Mr Salama, the WHO’s deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said Mbandaka’s location on the Congo river, widely used for transportation, raised the prospect of Ebola spreading to surrounding countries such as Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic as well as downstream to Kinshasa, a city of 10 million people.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	“This puts a whole different lens on this outbreak and gives us increased urgency to move very quickly into Mbandaka to stop this new first sign of transmission,” he said.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	The BBC adds that the WHO said it was not recommending any trade or travel restrictions either within DR Congo, for example between Mbandaka and Kinshasa, or internationally.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	But Mr Salama said that 13 countries in the region were boosting border screening measures and said DR Congo itself was increasing exit screening measures.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	“The good news is that the DR Congo population is very used to Ebola outbreaks,” he added.

757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	They know as well that traditional healers can amplify the outbreak.”
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	As The Daily Mail notes, it is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in Congo since the disease made its first known appearance near its northern Ebola river in the 1970s.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	Ebola is most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in victims owing to damage done to blood vessels.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	The Mail reports that health workers have recorded confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in three health zones of Congo’s Equateur province, and have identified 432 people who may have had contact with the disease, the WHO said.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	Supplies sent to Congo included more than 300 body bags for safe burials in affected communities.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	The vaccine will be reserved for people suspected of coming into contact with the disease, as well as health workers.
757171650	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases	non-propaganda	The vaccine requires storage at a temperature between -60 and -80 degrees C, tricky in a country with unreliable electricity.

703806098	There Were “Active Shooters On The Runway” Bombshell Air Traffic Control Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals	non-propaganda	While there have been countless stories since the attack that raise the very real possibility that this was a false flag, one has stood out due to the fact that the person who released the information died shortly after.

999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	It is welcome that finally there has been a little pushback, including from leading journalists, to the Guardian’s long-running vilification of Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Reporter Luke Harding’s latest article, claiming that Donald Trump’s disgraced former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly visited Assange in Ecuador’s embassy in London on three occasions, is so full of holes that even hardened opponents of Assange in the corporate media are struggling to stand by it.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Faced with the backlash, the Guardian quickly – and very quietly – rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Instead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, “sources”.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The propaganda function of the piece is patent.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	It is intended to provide evidence for long-standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump, and Trump’s supposed backers in the Kremlin, to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The Guardian’s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative: that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party’s servers.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	In truth, there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked, or that Russia was involved.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Central actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Nonetheless, this unverified allegation has been aggressively exploited by the Democratic leadership because it shifts attention away both from its failure to mount an effective electoral challenge to Trump and from the damaging contents of the emails.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	These show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton’s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, lost.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	To underscore the intended effect of the Guardian’s new claims, Harding even throws in a casual and unsubstantiated reference to “Russians” joining Manafort in supposedly meeting Assange.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Manafort has denied the Guardian’s claims, while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	‘Responsible for Trump’
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	The emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	But more significantly, it bolsters the otherwise risible claim that Assange is not a publisher – and thereby entitled to the protections of a free press, as enjoyed by the Guardian or the New York Times – but the head of an organisation engaged in espionage for a foreign power.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	The intention is to deeply discredit Assange, and by extension the Wikileaks organisation, in the eyes of right-thinking liberals.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	That, in turn, will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents: the use of new media to hold to account the old, corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	The Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador’s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	It will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	And it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	For the best part of a decade, any claims by Assange’s supporters that avoiding this fate was the reason Assange originally sought asylum in the embassy was ridiculed by corporate journalists, not least at the Guardian.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Even when a United Nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that Assange was being arbitrarily – and unlawfully – detained by the UK, Guardian writers led efforts to discredit the UN report.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	See here and here.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Now Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	An administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Heavy surveillance
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The problem for the Guardian, which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset, is that any visits by Manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed “sources”.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Glenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world, with CCTV cameras everywhere.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	The environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily, with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange’s fate.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The idea that Manafort or “Russians” could have wandered into the embassy to meet Assange even once without their trail, entry and meeting being intimately scrutinised and recorded is simply preposterous.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	According to Greenwald: “If Paul Manafort … visited Assange at the Embassy, there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The Guardian provides none of that.”
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Former British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Any visits by Manafort would have been logged.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	In fact, the Guardian obtained the embassy’s logs in May, and has never made any mention of either Manafort or “Russians” being identified in them.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	It did not refer to the logs in its latest story.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Murray:
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The problem with this latest fabrication is that [Ecuador’s President] Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Neither Manafort nor these “Russians” are in the visitor logs … What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency – who were in charge of the security – would not know the identity of these alleged “Russians”.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	No fact-checking
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	It is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true – both because Assange’s personal fate rests on their veracity, and because, even more importantly, a fundamental right, the freedom of the press, is at stake.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Given this, one would have expected the Guardian’s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with Harding’s story.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	At a very minimum, they should have sought out a response from Assange and Manafort before publication.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Neither precaution was taken.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	I worked for the Guardian for a number of years, and know well the layers of checks that any highly sensitive story has to go through before publication.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	In that lengthy process, a variety of commissioning editors, lawyers, backbench editors and the editor herself, Kath Viner, would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	And yet this piece seems to have been casually waved through, given a green light even though its profound shortcomings were evident to a range of well-placed analysts and journalists from the outset.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	That at the very least hints that the Guardian thought they had “insurance” on this story.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	And the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services – presumably of Britain, the United States and / or Ecuador.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	It appears the Guardian has simply taken this story, provided by spooks, at face value.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Even if it later turns out that Manafort did visit Assange, the Guardian clearly had no compelling evidence for its claims when it published them.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	That is profoundly irresponsible journalism – fake news – that should be of the gravest concern to readers.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	A pattern, not an aberration
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Despite all this, even analysts critical of the Guardian’s behaviour have shown a glaring failure to understand that its latest coverage represents not an aberration by the paper but decisively fits with a pattern.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Glenn Greenwald, who once had an influential column in the Guardian until an apparent, though unacknowledged, falling out with his employer over the Edward Snowden revelations, wrote a series of baffling observations about the Guardian’s latest story.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	First, he suggested it was simply evidence of the Guardian’s long-standing (and well-documented) hostility towards Assange.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	“The Guardian, an otherwise solid and reliable paper, has such a pervasive and unprofessionally personal hatred for Julian Assange that it has frequently dispensed with all journalistic standards in order to malign him.”
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	It was also apparently evidence of the paper’s clickbait tendencies:
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	“They [Guardian editors] knew that publishing this story would cause partisan warriors to excitedly spread the story, and that cable news outlets would hyperventilate over it, and that they’d reap the rewards regardless of whether the story turned out to be true or false.”
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	And finally, in a bizarre tweet, Greenwald opined, “I hope the story [maligning Assange] turns out true” – apparently because maintenance of the Guardian’s reputation is more important than Assange’s fate and the right of journalists to dig up embarrassing secrets without fear of being imprisoned.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	I think the Guardian is an important paper with great journalists.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	I hope the story turns out true.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	But the skepticism over this story is very widespread, including among Assange's most devoted haters, because it's so sketchy.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	If Manafort went there, there's video.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Let's see it.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) November 28, 2018
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Deeper malaise
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	What this misses is that the Guardian’s attacks on Assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	They are entirely predictable and systematic.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Rather than being the reason for the Guardian violating basic journalistic standards and ethics, the paper’s hatred of Assange is a symptom of a deeper malaise in the Guardian and the wider corporate media.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Even aside from its decade-long campaign against Assange, the Guardian is far from “solid and reliable”, as Greenwald claims.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	It has been at the forefront of the relentless, and unhinged, attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for prioritising the rights of Palestinians over Israel’s right to continue its belligerent occupation.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Over the past three years, the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobby’s desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti-semite.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	See here, here and here.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Similarly, the Guardian worked tirelessly to promote Clinton and undermine Sanders in the 2016 Democratic nomination process – another reason the paper has been so assiduous in promoting the idea that Assange, aided by Russia, was determined to promote Trump over Clinton for the presidency.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The Guardian’s coverage of Latin America, especially of populist leftwing governments that have rebelled against traditional and oppressive US hegemony in the region, has long grated with analysts and experts.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Its especial venom has been reserved for leftwing figures like Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez, democratically elected but official enemies of the US, rather than the region’s rightwing authoritarians beloved of Washington.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The Guardian has been vocal in the so-called “fake news” hysteria, decrying the influence of social media, the only place where leftwing dissidents have managed to find a small foothold to promote their politics and counter the corporate media narrative.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The Guardian has painted social media chiefly as a platform overrun by Russian trolls, arguing that this should justify ever-tighter restrictions that have so far curbed critical voices of the dissident left more than the right.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	non-propaganda	Heroes of the neoliberal order
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Equally, the Guardian has made clear who its true heroes are.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Certainly not Corbyn or Assange, who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Its pages, however, are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair, the man who led Britain, on false pretences, into the largest crime against humanity in living memory – the attack on Iraq.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	That “humanitarian intervention” cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the Middle East, sucked in Islamic jihadists like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and contributed to the migrant crisis in Europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the far-right.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	None of that is discussed in the Guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying Blair as an arbiter of what is good for Britain and the world’s future.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The Guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger Elliot Higgins, who, aided by the Guardian, has shot to unlikely prominence as a self-styled “weapons expert”.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Like Luke Harding, Higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the British and American security services need verifying “independently”.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Higgins and his well-staffed website Bellingcat have taken on for themselves the role of arbiters of truth on many foreign affairs issues, taking a prominent role in advocating for narratives that promote US and NATO hegemony while demonising Russia, especially in highly contested arenas such as Syria.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	That clear partisanship should be no surprise, given that Higgins now enjoys an “academic” position at, and funding from, the Atlantic Council, a high-level, Washington-based think-tank founded to drum up support for NATO and justify its imperialist agenda.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Improbably, the Guardian has adopted Higgins as the poster-boy for a supposed citizen journalism it has sought to undermine as “fake news” whenever it occurs on social media without the endorsement of state-backed organisations.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	With this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	Its job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: whether they are a platform like Wikileaks promoting whistle-blowing against a corrupt western elite; or a politician like Jeremy Corbyn seeking to break apart the status quo on the rapacious financial industries or Israel-Palestine; or a radical leader like Hugo Chavez who threatened to overturn a damaging and exploitative US dominance of “America’s backyard”; or social media dissidents who have started to chip away at the elite-friendly narratives of corporate media, including the Guardian.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	The Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	It did what it is designed to do.
999001619	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange	propaganda	UPDATE: Excellent background from investigative journalist Gareth Porter, published shortly before Harding’s story, explains why the Guardian’s hit-piece is so important for those who want Assange out of the embassy and behind bars.

111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	non-propaganda	Garcia Zarate's defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident — they said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it.
111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	propaganda	"Lead attorney Matt Gonzalez has argued that the weapon was a SIG Sauer with a ""hair trigger in single-action mode"" — a model well-known for accidental discharges even among experienced shooters."

111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	non-propaganda	Beyond the shooting itself, perhaps the most controversial aspect of Garcia Zarate's case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations, and how San Francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot Steinle.

111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	propaganda	"Due to San Francisco's policy of limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities — which some refer to as a ""sanctuary"" policy — the city did not inform ICE when they released Garcia Zarate."
111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	non-propaganda	As a result of the case, both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policies.

111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	non-propaganda	But ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Francisco's custody.
111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	non-propaganda	The agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courts.
111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	non-propaganda	Though the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up, their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding.
111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	non-propaganda	San Francisco's policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judge-signed warrants, and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates' Fourth Amendment rights.

111111113	Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing	non-propaganda	Lax border security, too, does not appear to be a factor since Garcia Zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country under the Obama administration.

758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The Francis Vatican’s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Contemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	It has no “use” in the sense that either the Bergoglians – in terms of their political machinations – or the world can understand.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	There is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	One aspect of Pope Francis’ character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life – a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church’s undertakings.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The world does not understand it or want it.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Therefore, it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side, and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	So when, in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns, the faithful braced for impact .
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	In his recent document, ostensibly on holiness, “Gaudete et Exultate,” the pope attacked the religious desire for silence and solitude, to be alone with God in prayer, seeking unity with Him, saying in essence that the Christian life is inherently about social activism, about material, worldly ends.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	To these foundations of the contemplative life – indeed of any form of religious life in the Church – Francis set up another of his false dichotomies, contemplation in opposition to serving others, giving a Jesuit maxim as an imperative for all Catholics: “We are called to be contemplatives even in the midst of action, and to grow in holiness by responsibly and generously carrying out our proper mission.”
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Italian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly, “Rejoice and be glad… but not if you’re a cloistered contemplative.”
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	In 2016, I wrote that Francis’ Apostolic Constitution, “Vultum dei quaerere” was in some respects the most damaging object of the wrecking-ball pontificate to date.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Unfortunately, it was about a subject that the world, and therefore the modern Church, cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Aimed specifically at female contemplative religious, the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The new document issued last week, “Cor orans,” is juridical, that is, it is not much more than a list of specific norms, or rules – 289 of them!
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	– that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	One odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	“A monastery of nuns, as every religious house, is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute.” (emphasis added)
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Wait… its “usefulness”?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	I think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be, “According to what specific criteria is a monastery’s ‘usefulness’ actually determined?”
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	One can’t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	A house that could prove to the secularists that it was “useful” – that it could care for the indigent elderly, teach children or nurse the sick – would be allowed to continue.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Those which were purely contemplative – a single-minded devotion to the adoration of God – were closed.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	It is not an insignificant quirk of modern history, and one that tells us much about the nature of the current pontificate, that houses of contemplatives are always attacked by secularist regimes, from Henry VIII to the Soviet Union.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Rupture?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	What rupture?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post-Vatican II theology.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	In the Introduction, it seems anxious to establish a “hermeneutic of continuity” with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The authors insist there is no contradiction between the two – except, of course, where there are contradictions – and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the “aim of their specific vocation.” It describes Francis as promulgating this document “in the wake” of Pius XII[1].
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	In fact, Pope Francis, by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere, on June 29, 2016, to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation, invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular, but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	As a consequence, the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	But of course, the entire game is given away in the next paragraph:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Pope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Yes, that’s what it said.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Here’s my translation:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	“The Church’s ‘path’ of the last 50 years has been ‘fruitful’.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	How do you know?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Because we’re telling you it has.”
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	In other words, there have been absolutely no problems whatever with the direction taken either by the Church or by the religious life since Vatican II.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Everything that has happened has been in complete and perfect continuity between the Before Church and the After Church; there has been no rupture or break with the past.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	All changes undertaken by religious houses were perfectly legitimate and good - “fruitful” if, perhaps, a bit “intense” – and have been made in “light of the teachings” of Vatican II and “changed socio-cultural conditions.” There is, therefore, no legitimate reason whatever for any religious house to attempt to “turn back the clock” to the pre-Vatican II norms or styles of religious life.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Anyone attempting to do this are Bad Nuns [insert string of incomprehensible papal insults here.]
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	This is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document; “Nothing to see here.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	And if you say there is, you’re the problem.”
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Of course, this kind of bold proclamation is very much in keeping with the habit of this pontificate to simply claim there are no problems and become gravely offended and outraged when the contrary is pointed out.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	It’s your fault if you find contradictions, not theirs; they’ve said there are no contradictions, therefore there aren’t any.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	After all, this is the papacy where 2 + 2 = 5 if the pope says it does.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	The irony, of course, is built in, since this document is intended as a legal chopping block for the dissolution of any house of contemplative nuns that is judged to be hovering on the edge of extinction or is for some other reason in need of the chop.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Why would the Vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since Vatican II has been hunky dory?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Let’s remember that this comes from the Congregation for Religious of Braz de’Aviz and Jose Rodriguez Carballo.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	This is the Cardinal Braz de’Aviz[2] who wasted no time in orienting himself in the New Paradigm when, close on the heels of the Conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor – and by extension Pope Benedict – to reign in the notorious Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the US.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	He complained that he had been shut out of the process under Cardinal Rode, and later made a large and public point of appeasing and mollifying the most outspokenly heretical and politicised organisation of female religious in the world.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Apparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following Vatican II[3] had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life – always claimed to be “mandated” by “the Council”.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	And of course we are talking about the priorities of a pope who has said that seeing a “restorationist” community enjoying a large number of vocations makes him “worry.” Apparently this worry was serious enough to move him to torpedo one of the most flourishing communities in the modern Church; the gaunt spectre of the Franciscan Friars and Sisters of the Immaculate haunts this document.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Autonomy vs.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Independence
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	One of the talking points the media have latched onto is the whole business of “autonomy” of monasteries.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Many of the headlines crowed: “Vatican confirms nuns’ autonomy,” or similar.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	But that word does not mean what they think it means.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	In fact, the word “autonomy” is the key to understanding this whole thing.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	It appears in the document 16 times and “autonomous” 30 times.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	In fact, “autonomy” is held up as the single most important criterion for determining a monastery’s viability.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	This emphasis is repeated so often one might almost think there is a concern in Rome that the “fruitful” post-conciliar monastic life is in danger of fizzling out… for… some reason…
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Monastery sui juris refers to the religious house of a female monastic community that, having the requisites for real autonomy of life, was legitimately erected by the Holy See and enjoys juridical autonomy under the law.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	18 In order to obtain juridical autonomy for a monastery of nuns, it must presuppose a real autonomy of life, that is, the ability to manage the life of the monastery in all its dimensions (vocational, formative, governmental, relational, liturgical, economic ...).
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	In this case, an autonomous monastery is alive and vital.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	43 Autonomy of life, a constant prerequisite for maintaining juridical autonomy, must be constantly verified by the Federal President who, when in her judgment a monastery lacks autonomy of life, must inform the Holy See in view of the nomination of an ad hoc commission.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	67 Affiliation [with another monastery, appointed by the Vatican] can be an opportunity for recovery and rebirth when autonomy of life is partially compromised.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	If the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	no longer possesses a real autonomy of life , it is the responsibility of the Federation President to report the matter to the Holy See.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	When an autonomous monastery , it is the responsibility ofto the Holy See.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	At the same time, this document is redefining the term “autonomous” to exclude independence.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	What got no mention in the brief press interest was the document’s insistence that all monasteries of nuns must belong to a federation and while monasteries must demonstrate “autonomy” they will be granted little in the way of powers of self-governance.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	As we will see, the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves Orwell in the dust:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	overcome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Federation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same Institute [4] , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, so that in sharing the same charism, the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Note the change: “independent” is replaced with “isolated[5].” It reminds me of a conversation I had with a superior of a Benedictine house in the UK.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	She said she thought that the psychiatric testing, that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery’s federation, was excessive and not helpful.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	She didn’t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate’s suitability for religious life, so she didn’t require these tests of her monastery’s postulants.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	She also said that she was under constant pressure, both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation’s leadership.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Was that monastery “isolated”?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Or just exercising lawful self-governance?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	And given that autonomy is being held up as the sole criterion for viability of a monastery, it seems the Holy See is not interested in asking whether it is actually faithful to the charism, or even to the Catholic Faith, a question that has burned brightly for serious Catholics for some time.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The word “fidelity” appears in the document four times, which may give an idea of how much interest the Vatican has in this issue.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Funny you should mention autonomy: Bioethics and the dissolution of “unviable” monasteries
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	It’s funny that the buzzword of the day in Rome should be “autonomy”.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	As we shall see, the document is what I’ve called above a “chopping block”.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Vultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable, religious life worthy of life, so to speak, and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Note the language used here:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	If the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	It jogged a memory for me.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	“Incapacity”… Where had I heard that language used before?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Most pro-life observers in Britain will tell you that it was the “Mental Capacity Act” of 2005 that established in British law the concept that a person with permanently “reduced capacity” could be legally starved and/or dehydrated to death by doctors.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	This is the world, the language, of Bioethics, applied utilitarianism, also called “Principlism” after its three bioethical criteria of “justice, beneficence[6] and autonomy” – it is a patient’s ability to demonstrate his “autonomy” or “quality of life,[7]” either currently or potentially, that decides his fate.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	This set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now, a “new paradigm” of ethics replacing traditional “Hippocratic” or “Natural Law” medical ethics.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Under this system the onus, effectively, is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment – of continuing to live.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Medical treatment (which legally includes food and water) can be withdrawn from patients who fail to demonstrate that they will recover sufficiently to return to an autonomous lifestyle.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Health care systems like that of the UK have government regulatory boards giving out “guidelines” to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	These guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	If the equation doesn’t come out in the patient’s favour, the “treatment” recommended for the patient’s “best interests” will include his demise, often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The NHS in the UK has actually gone to court, and won, declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the Bioethics test.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	The result has been a quiet reign of terror in which elderly and disabled people have started carrying cards stating in legalese that they do not want to be killed by their doctors.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	In one case a man with ALS took the NHS to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The system, in other words, is stacked against the patient, in favour of the government that holds all the cards.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Keep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	I think we can find an almost perfect analogy by replacing the term “patient” with “monastery.” Think about how one would apply concepts like “autonomy,” “viability,” “incapacity,” “quality of life” and “equitable distribution of scarce resources” to this context.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	When the language of utilitarianism appears in Vatican documents as guiding criteria for the contemplative religious life, one has to wonder at what point has the entire project gone so disastrously off the rails.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Federations as Vatican watchdogs
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Under this law, all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Previously only voluntary and consultative, federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates, nuns and of their formators, as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	The document makes it inarguable that the federation’s main role will be to establish and monitor for conformity to a particular programme – the “intense and fruitful path” of the Church since 1965 – both within the various orders and between them:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The Federal Assembly:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	deals with issues of major importance; makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe, after the definitive approval of the Holy See;
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	More than just federations; a multi-tier system of control
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Conference of monasteries means a structure of communion among autonomous monasteries, belonging to diverse Institutes and present in the same region... in particular geographical or linguistic contexts.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	In other words, Benedictine federations of a given area will form a “Conference” with Carmelite federations and Dominican federations and Poor Clare federations, etc.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	This will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially, since they tend to be generally more on the “conservative” end of things.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Imagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings – and attempting to keep up their Office schedule – with the balloons-and-guitars, break dancing Franciscans…What fun!
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	And finally, just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock, there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas; there will be watchers watching the watchers:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Confederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries, erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism, to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Broad powers
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Federations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and, crucially, over formation of nuns.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	It is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules, to report non-compliance to the Holy See, to make new foundations and, apparently, to “encourage” individual monasteries to “communicate” their goods.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire, possess, administer, and alienate temporal, movable and immovable goods, which are ecclesiastical assets, in accordance with the universal and proper law.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	To keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries, implementing one of the aims of the Federation, a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries, coordinated by the Federal President.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions, gifts, loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties, and for the common needs of the Federation.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Financial incentives
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Given that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like “vitality in living and transmitting the charism” and “dynamic fidelity” to the order’s charism, and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation, one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8].
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Since the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery, this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Article 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek “legal recognition also in the civil sphere.” This, presumably, will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Article 73, on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	In the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery, when there are no surviving nuns, unless otherwise provided by the Holy See, the destination of the suppressed monastery's assets, in compliance with canon and civil law, go to the respective higher juridical person, that is, to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The economic fund [of the federation] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries, by the donations of benefactors, and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries, as established by the present Instruction.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Federations in charge of formation
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The Federation President, in particular, watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute, so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	At the end of the visit, she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation, therefore, the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation; if this does not happen, she will refer the matter to the Holy See.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The President of the Federation, having heard the opinion of the Federal Council, chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators, as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority, establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Who makes new foundations and why?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Throughout the history of the Church, it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Now, with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right, according to this document, the federations themselves can make foundations.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	through the action of the Federation, as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns, keeping in mind what is established in no.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	39 of the present Instruction, can take place either by a single monastery or, as established by the Federal Assembly [9]
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	A single monastic community that decides to make a foundation, moreover, must be “helped” and guided by the federation:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Article 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that “must be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective.”
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism,” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	a) A community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with “” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	b) Besides the number, special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume: as Superior, the service of authority; as formator, the initial formation of candidates; as financial administrator, the administration of the goods of the monastery.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	c) Rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community, to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their Institute.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	d) Economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	One of these things is not like the others.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Did you notice?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	One criterion stands out as indeterminate, vague, compared with the other concrete and measurable standards.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	One aspect of legislative analysis that I learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	If a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a “loophole”.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Or it could perhaps be described as a handle; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	So, how, exactly, is it to be determined – and by whom – that a group of nuns possess “the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism”?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	What, precisely, does the term “vitality” mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Is this one of Pope Francis little personal, secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Like the secret to how nuns are to smile properly?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Does the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Or is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	The next article tells us, “It is the responsibility of the Holy See to evaluate the presence of these requisites.” Do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the Congregation for Religious that measures “charism vitality”?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	It seems important to ask because article 70, on how to suppress a monastery, includes it:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Among the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery, after having examined all the circumstances, the following points should be considered as a whole: the number of nuns, the advanced age of the majority of the members, the real capacity for government and formation, lack of candidates for a number of years, lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity[10].
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	You will be affiliated; resistance is futile…
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	It seems there are two themes running through the document: to establish a certain value of “autonomy” as the indispensable criterion for viability, while at the same time asserting top-down oversight and control over who gets to make this determination.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	In short, a monastery must be autonomous, but heaven help the community that asserts its independence.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Articles 54-64 offer an interim measure in the case of “incapacity” that is really just more of the second thing.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Once a lack of autonomy has been established…
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	54 Affiliation is a particular form of help that the Holy See establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy, but in reality, very precarious or, in fact, non-existent.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	55 Affiliation is configured as a juridical support that must assess whether the inability to manage the life of the autonomous monastery in all its dimensions is only temporary or is irreversible, helping the community of the affiliated monastery to overcome difficulties or to put in place what is necessary to bring about the suppression of this monastery.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	How does affiliation work?
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Well, the federation and the Holy See between them work it out:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	In these cases, it is up to the Holy See to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the Ordinary, the Federation President, the Federal Assistant, and the Major Superior of the monastery
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	It’s starting to be clear that the federation is going to be little more than the Big Brother hit-squad of the Congregation for Religious.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	It’s worth remembering what happened in the case of a German men’s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to pre-Vatican II practices.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Mariawald Trappist monastery – 900 years old – was finally dissolved, affiliated to death.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Its superior had made the fatal error of openly declaring – in 2008, after the publication of Summorum Pontificum – that the monastery’s problems all began when it adopted the new liturgical rites and implemented the trends of all religious after Vatican II, and that clearly the solution was to go back to pre-conciliar ways.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Mariawald was consequently affiliated, in the manner this document describes, with a liberal house in the Netherlands whose superior, unsurprisingly, discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	What would make forced affiliation a truly devastating weapon against conservative or traditional communities is the proviso that an affiliated monastery may not form its own novices:
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	60 The affiliated monastery can accept candidates, but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the Federation.”
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Of course, this means it is the affiliating monastery’s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant, “neo-pelagian” postulants and novices.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	~
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	This brings us to about article 155 of the document.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Part two to come.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	_______________
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	[1] It would seem, therefore, that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read Sponsa Christi Ecclesia as well as Francis’ Apostolic Constitution and make a careful comparison.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	I’m not going to do that here, but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	[2] Worth remembering, however, is the fact that it was Benedict the “conservative,” not Francis, who appointed Braz de’ Aviz in the office to replace Cardinal Rode – presumably under that good old “conservative” rubric of the “big umbrella” – under whom these culpably belated attempts to save US religious life were started.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	[3] Just considering the numbers of course.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Leaving alone the doctrinal issues.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	[4] “The same Institute” means the order in question, whether Benedictine, Dominican, Carmelite etc.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	[5] I’d love to hear from some monastic superior who had the nerve to tell Rome, “Actually, given that all our neighbours in religion are raging neo-modernist heretics, if not schismatics, we think ‘isolation’ is a desirable thing – like quarantine during an outbreak of Bubonic Plague – and would therefore like to be dispensed from the federation requirement.” I’d pay good money to see the shade of purple the well-fed Braz de’Aviz turned.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	[6] “justice and beneficence” are considered on behalf of the community, not the patient
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	[7] Bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient “quality” it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	Dependence upon the care of others is, quite literally, a capital offence.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	[8] Readers may think I’m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries, but as we will see, the distinction between the federations and the Holy See is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the Congregation for Religious, Jose Rodrigues Carballo, was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of “tens of millions” of Euros from the coffers of the Franciscan Friars Minor, the original Franciscan order of which he had been the head.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Shortly after Carballo’s appointment, it was revealed that the Swiss prosecutor’s office was investigating the money missing from the Friars Minor in connection with drugs, money laundering operations and gun running.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	Carballo was Francis’ very first appointment, April 6, 2013, three weeks after the Conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the FFIs, and a major part of that operation was to separate the FFIs from real assets valued at about 30 million Euros.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	[9] So much for the principle of subsidiarity.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	non-propaganda	I can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in.
758386255	Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders	propaganda	[10] We’ll pass over “dynamic fidelity” in silence for now…

772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	President Trump seemed to be publicly siding with the Russian dictator against the American intelligence agencies.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	The initial appearance was so bad that I tweeted: “President Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected – immediately.”
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	After flying home from Helsinki and reviewing the tape and transcript of his press conference with Putin, President Trump said he has “full faith and support for America’s great intelligence agencies” and that he accepts “our intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election took place.”
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	In his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	The president said: “It should have been obvious – I thought it would be obvious – but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn’t.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of “wouldn’t.” The sentence should have been: I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t – or why it wouldn’t be Russia.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	So just to repeat it, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t’ …
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	“I have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	Unlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts – and repel – we will stop it, we will repel it – any efforts to interfere in our elections.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	We’re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.”
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	Anyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	His natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	For him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one).
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	President Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration’s failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	President Trump noted that President Obama and his advisers had information that the Russians had been working to interfere in the election and they ignored it, because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	President Trump said: “President Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now – probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks – they knew about Russia’s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	And as I said, they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	It turned out it didn’t happen that way.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	“By contrast, my administration has taken a very firm stance – it’s a very firm stance – on a strong action.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	We’re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process.”
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	There are two key facts in this statement.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	First, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	The very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	It was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	Second, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	The Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	The Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	Also, President Trump’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	Furthermore, President Trump’s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	The stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	Beyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia:
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	When the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	When the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	Despite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	Finally, a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	We are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	This is what led me to write my new New York Times best-selling book, “Trump’s America: The Truth About Our Nation’s Great Comeback.” With each passing month the radical-extremist wing of the Democratic Party dominates the progressive wing more and more.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	With President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	In fact, the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	Similarly, Obama-era national security officials seem determined to use the harshest possible language to attack President Trump.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	I think their strong words and hysteria are driven by their own guilt.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	Whatever the Russians did, they did while Brennan was director of the CIA, Clapper was director of national intelligence, and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	propaganda	These former officials attack Trump ferociously to hide their own failure and their own guilt.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	Just keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV.
772947654	Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama	non-propaganda	My prediction is that President Trump will remain tough on Russia, and the Helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was.

701553469	Jewish and Pro-Israel Students Kicked Off University Board for Opposing BDS	propaganda	You will remember Sadikov as the student politician who in February told his followers to “punch a Zionist today.” It is unclear whether Sadikov has faced any disciplinary action for this incitement to violence from your administration.

701553469	Jewish and Pro-Israel Students Kicked Off University Board for Opposing BDS	propaganda	Rather, it has been nurtured in part by a toxic campus press, especially the McGill Daily, a publication which openly refuses to publish any “Zionist” content.

711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	As we detailed earlier, in a verdict that has shocked many in the Bay Area (and across America), a jury of six men and six women in sanctuary city San Francisco found illegal immigrant (and five-time deportee) Jose Ines Garcia Zarate not guilty in the death of Kate Steinle.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	Mr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions and five prior deportations to Mexico.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	He had been set free from jail only months before the shooting, in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities, who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	propaganda	The backlash to his release into the community crescendoed when Donald Trump invoked Ms. Steinle’s killing as he campaigned for president.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	propaganda	As The New York Times reports, Ms. Steinle’s death in July 2015 fed into a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status should be deported more aggressively, and over the role local law enforcement should play.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	Ms. Steinle, known as Kate, a 32-year-old medical equipment saleswoman, was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father’s arms.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	Mr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon, but said it was an accident.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	propaganda	Zarate and his defense team maintained the argument that the suspect found the stolen weapon on the pier that day and it “just fired.” The gun belonged to a federal Bureau of Land Management ranger and was stolen from his parked car a week earlier.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	The bullet ricocheted on the pier’s concrete walkway before it struck Steinle, killing her.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	Zarate has admitted to shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	Defense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier… but the stories of what happened copntradicted one another…
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	He said it was wrapped in cloth, and when Garcia Zarate unwrapped it, the gun accidentally discharged.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	But in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	He also told police that he stepped on the gun, causing it to fire.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	But still, after six days of deliberation, the illegal Mexcian immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges and also found not guilty of assault with a firearm.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	Garcia Zarate was found guilty of illegal firearms possession, which carries a sentence of 16 months to three years.

711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	propaganda	The public defender wasted no time in focusing his thoughts on President Trump and his administration…saying Zarate was “extremely relieved” by the outcome and that while Steinle’s death “was a horrible tragedy,” it was used as “political fodder for then candidate Donald Trump’s anti-immigration agenda.”
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	propaganda	Adachi added, “Despite the unfairly politicized atmosphere surrounding this case, jurors focused on the evidence, which was clear and convincing, and rendered a just verdict.”
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	In a response to the verdict, Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement saying that despite California’s attempt at a murder conviction, Zarate was able to walk away with only a firearm possession conviction because he was not turned over by San Francisco to ICE.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	propaganda	“When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public’s safety at risk,” the statement said.
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	propaganda	“San Francisco’s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.” Sessions continued, “I urge the leaders of the nation’s communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers.”
711596363	Trump Slams “Disgraceful Verdict” After San Francisco Jury Acquits “Kate’s Law”-Victim’s Killer	non-propaganda	Social media erupted with outrage at the verdict (with very few – if any attempting to defend the verdict)…

780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	There is nothing about these stories that is okay.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	These actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Faced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	And why?
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	The reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	We are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	So what is new?
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the “wages of sin.”
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	For too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Why do we do this?
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “pastoral?” Have we covered over the truth out of fear?
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Perhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In the end, the excuses do not matter.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	We must be done with sin.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Love sinners?
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Yes.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Accept true repentance?
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Yes.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	But do not say sin is okay.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	For the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	The deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	If you’ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	As the Book of Proverbs says “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	8:7).” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	There must be no room left, no refuge for sin — either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	To be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In this I speak of all sin.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	But to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual — almost exclusively homosexual — acts by clerics.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	We’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	There has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	That is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	The well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	While recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	It is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	The Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	And the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	Such wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	But while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	At the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Motivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	The sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	It causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	However, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	No matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Here now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Here again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	To our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	I will address it swiftly and vigorously.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	I will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	I trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	To our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	You are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	This is to keep you very close to God.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	And by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	God will give you the graces to do so.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	And if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	I will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	To the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	It will be addressed quickly and justly.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	Such actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Again, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Furthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Failure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I ask everyone reading this to pray.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	Pray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	Pray for our seminarians.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	propaganda	And pray for yourselves and your families.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	We must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Finally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	In addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Some sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	This letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	More than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	We must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Again, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I stand with them.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	I don’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally.
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	But I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Faithfully yours in the Lord,
780414700	Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus	non-propaganda	Most Rev.

777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	A word must be said on the full meaning of penalty.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	Most of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings, and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	In those theories, the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law, so as to teach the guilty to live honestly, but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed, which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty .

777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	In the metaphysical order, penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will, dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	If it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re-establish the violated law, it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	Today the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely, even in cases of proven premeditated murder.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	Despite the fact that it was instituted by God Himself, growing numbers of Catholics actually consider it immoral.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	John Paul II, stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle, has declared that it should be imposed very seldom, if ever.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	But doesn’t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice?
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	In the U.S., following the lead of the late Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago and like minded prelates won to the new man-centered conciliar religion, the faithful are beginning to equate abortion, nuclear war and capital punishment as common “threats to the sacredness of human life” without any reference whatever to the innocence or guilt involved.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	If they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self-defense, to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime, they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic “tradition which comes from the Apostles” actually “develops in the Church” and keeps pace with changing times (II,8).
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	The circumstances pertaining to our day would therefore dictate a reassessment of the death penalty, which the new man-centered theology insists on viewing almost exclusively from the standpoint of the criminal and human society rather than from God’s.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	At the same time, there is more and more discussion about society’s responsibility for having produced criminals in the first place, together with our moral obligation to rehabilitate them rather than to wreak what is now considered a form of fruitless, guilty “vengeance” on them.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	The idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	According to one widely held opinion, the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case, and should be discarded as impractical.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	What proof of this can possibly be offered?
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	How can we know?
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	Deterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case, yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	To a man proven to have given false witness against another, Deuteronomy laid down, “They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother.

777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	To illustrate how shallow Catholic thinking on the death penalty has become and how far it has deviated from the age-old doctrine of the Church, a priest of a presumably traditional Catholic Fraternity writes in answer to a query addressed to him on the subject by saying:
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	The death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians, but is not itself a declared dogma.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	Therefore it is not permissible to call those who hold it is, immoral heretics.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	To approach this as a dogmatic teaching is imprudent.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	Those who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	Those, however, who maintain its continued use often see it more as a tool for revenge.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	Please consider that in anger and tragedy, the desire for revenge usually overrides reason and an honest answering of the question “must this person’s life be taken to preserve society?” The desire for swift and firm convictions has sent many to death who never deserved such a punishment, nor was such a punishment truly necessary for the safety of society.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	I do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied.

777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	is not unjust or incorrect.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	That the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge, and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	Given the fallen human condition, such injustices are bound to occur in any judicial system, and everyone agrees that they should be ruthlessly remedied.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	What is not irrelevant is that the author of the letter falls headlong into the very error Pius XII warns against.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	Considering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal, he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded, allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	That the penalty is due primarily as expiation to God in justice, and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	The supernatural dimension of the punishment as an agent for the spiritual good of both society and the criminal is furthermore not only not addressed, but treated as non-existent.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	This first appeared in The Remnant nearly 20 years ago.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	Isn't it time to subscribe to the 'paper of record' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution?
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	The source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the Church is not hard to trace.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	According to statistics published in the National Review for September 16, 1983, out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council, 56 persons were executed.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	In 1965, the year the Council closed, although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850, only 7 were executed.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	In the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	At its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	At this point, although the murder rate has continued to rise dramatically, executions continue to be rare.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	Many nations, notably England, France, Sweden, South Africa and our neighbors Canada and Mexico, have abolished the death penalty altogether.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	Whether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	What leaps to the eye from the mounting statistics is that decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the Faith and church attendance.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	It is sober fact that death sentences were liberally handed out in the heyday of Christendom, when the Faith was strong and governments legislated with an eye to the spiritual welfare of citizens whose sights were primarily on future bliss in heaven.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	In modern times, which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government, secularism has become the state religion, directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	It is only to be expected that materialists—for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has—should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	In their eyes this means total extinction, a penalty certainly in excess of any transgression of which he may be guilty.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	Not even God completely obliterates a human existence, not even for the most odious sins, for He made the human soul immortal and hell eternal.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	(It might be argued, however, that if the criminal is thought to have to have totally terminated his victim, why not do the same to him?)
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	In the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	Justice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	Nor was the idea of “rehabilitation” with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	It has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance, whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	As it is, the death penalty as administered by society must be viewed against the backdrop of divine revelation if it is to make any real sense.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	When Catholic society puts a man to death, it terminates only his temporal life on earth, catapulting him into eternity for his final judgment before almighty God.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	Suffering the penalty not only allows the criminal to render expiation to God and to society, but if accepted in Christ’s grace with due repentance, it preserves his soul from hell and eliminates much of his purgatory.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	If his contrition is perfect, it’s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven!
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	non-propaganda	In any case, neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	As Michel Martin pointed out in an article in Rome et d’Ailleurs for September-October 1983, “The truth is that the problem of the death penalty is insoluble except from a Christian point of view.” That it figured so prominently in Christian societies is due to the fact that, in the order of charity, atonement to God was sought above any atonement due to man, and the spiritual welfare of citizens above their physical well-being.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	Modern secularized society assumes that physical extinction is the worst thing that can happen to a human being, whereas the faith teaches that eternal damnation is incalculably worse.
777488669	The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)	propaganda	In the context of the faith, the importance of a man’s present short life on earth cannot be compared with his future endless existence in heaven.
