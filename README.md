# Projects
Contains code, pdf files, and data for a few projects, mainly to do with Natural Language Processing.
These projects feature usage of logistic regression, convolutional neural networks, reccurrent neural networks, etc.

## For CW2, contains:
This is a folder that contains the files for Propaganda Classification using convolutions neural nets in PyTorch.

   #### - pickle file of final convolutional neural network file 
   #### - cw1-train-official.ipynb - contains code for training
   #### - cw2-test.ipynb - contains code for testing
   #### - glove vectors are large and can be found at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
   #### - Keep in mind that if you do not have a GPU, use Google Collab to run the code
