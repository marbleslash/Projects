Subject: Summary on Bremen Deal

Hi George,

as requested just a quick summary on the Bremen transaction which was final=
ly=20
signed by Bremen on Thursday (yesterday I also received the signed contract=
=20
from Bremen).

 Term:
 from 1 May 2001 to December 2006, although we have already delivered since=
=20
1/1/01 under the same contract terms as the long-term agreement.

 Volume:
 4.6 Mio. t firm over 6 years=20
  2001: 935=20
  2002: 820
  2003: 820
  2004: 820
  2005: 615 (tail-off due to expected shut-down of one block)=20
  2006: 615=20
 For 2002 to 2006, this will cover about 80% of Bremen's needs. We can be=
=20
very confident to also attract the remaining 20% in the open tenders due to=
=20
advantages on logistics and possible matching of best price.

 Quality:
 Generic with very generous quality specs (wider than SECA; also allows for=
=20
1.7% sulphur)
 Under the deal we can also deliver 10% as pet coke (if the blend meets the=
=20
wide quality specs)

 Pricing:=20
 We deliver CIF @ BAW price. BAW is weighted average import price which lag=
s=20
the market by 2-3 quarters. In rising markets we lose against spot purchase=
,=20
in falling market we win against it.
 If Bremen takes less than 10% pet coke, we will get a premium for each %=
=20
point that Bremen underlifts. In this case, we are either financially deeme=
d=20
to have delivered pet coke (we get the difference between BAW price and pet=
=20
coke) or a fixed premium of $0.15/t per each % point (max. of BAW price +=
=20
$1.50)

 Strategic Advantages of Deal:
 -  Significant position in the German market; breakthrough transaction in=
=20
the German market =01) this transaction represents about 3% of current Germ=
an=20
coal imports. It will make us one of the established players and help foste=
r=20
our track record in Germany.
 -  Longer-term volume flow in Northern Germany that will create economies =
of=20
scale for the supply of smaller customers in the area;
 -  Building Nordenham as the bridgehead for the supply of Northern Germany=
;=20
With increasing imports into Germany the Bremen volumes will enable ECS to=
=20
take an active port position in Nordenham. This may be valuable since port=
=20
capacity will have increasing value (currently under scrutiny).
 -  Optionality on remaining synor tonnage; abilitay to fill in remaining 2=
0%=20
of Bremen needs. This can already be seen this year where we are expected t=
o=20
deliver 935,000 instead of the contracted 820,000.
 - Upside from delivery of more of 10% of contractual volumes as petroleum=
=20
coke (we can do this, if technically ok - under the contract Bremen actuall=
y=20
has incentives to burn more than 10%).
 - Follow-on Deals with Bremen; we have started discussions on a coal-fired=
=20
power block that Bremen would like to rent out to us and Bremen has offered=
=20
us to do all their port business in Nordenham (thus, we would transform CIF=
=20
deal into FOB deal) which would strengthen our position in Nordenham).

George, if you have any questions related to the deal and its structure,=20
please do not hesitate to call either Manfred or myself (011-49 173 3070824=
).

Kind regards
Sven

Mike - I think we are doing a good job of isolating ourselves from the direct 
risk of owning synfuel machines.  The equity owners are the ones at risk for 
any amendments to Section 29 of the tax code.  Further, we have identified 
the "Class A" machines in the market, those with the strongest PLR 's, legal 
facts, and credit worthy owners, and have concentrated our activities on only 
those machines.
  
We will be responsible for supplying coal to the machines, a short position 
we enjoy today with our term sales of equity coal to Florida Powers' synfuel 
group and traded coal to Sempra, and act as sales agent (obviously with 
obligations to sell) for the resultant synfuel. The deals we are currently 
negotiating with AIG and PacifiCorp are even more favorable then our Sempra 
deal in that we will not be acting as operator of the machines.  We also 
expect to receive mark to market  accounting treatment on the new deals.  As 
point of reference we think AIG will be worth about $25 mm and PacifiCorp 
north of $50 mm.  Although we have yet to mtm the Sempra deal, it is worth 
about $25 mm on a mtm basis. 

Between the above three deals we have over $100 mm of potential income this 
year.  In addition we will enter into long term short positions with the 
machines, which will allow us to expand our physical flows, and continue to 
grow our business.  As an example, this year we will deliver about 12 - 15 mm 
tons of eastern coal.  If we successfully conclude the AIG and PacifiCorp 
deals, we will move an additional 11 - 13 mm tpy of eastern coal.  Sempra 
will add another 2 mm tpy, for a total of 13 - 15 mm tpy.  We will be in a 
position to virtually double our physical flows of eastern coal next year.

Synfuel has already had a significant impact on a number of regional markets. 
Not only do we want to be in the synfuel business, we need to be in the 
business in order to understand, anticipate, and take advantage of rapidly 
changing market dynamics.  Synfuel represents a significant, fundamental 
change in the coal business.  This changing market  will present new 
opportunities for us to develop and exploit.  The key obviously is to be a 
major player in both the synfuel and underlying coal markets in order to take 
advantage of the information flows generated by each market. 

We are already in the process of meeting with international customers about 
supplying them with synfuel.  We have received a favorable reaction from both 
the international utilities and steel mills.  We will gain a significant 
competitive advantage in the international market by being in a position to 
offer synfuel not only through Pier IX in Virginia (Sempra), but also through 
New Orleans (AIG and PacifiCorp - via terminal sites on the Ohio River 
system).

We have asked our regulatory people to stay on top of any activity in 
Washington, and to date synfuel has not been a significant political issue.  
Jordan has directed our outside tax people to monitor the IRS' temperature,  
and their response to any letters they receive regarding synfuel from members 
of Congress or the industry. The noise in the system has been primarily 
generated by Arch Coal Co. who are not active in the synfuel market; and the 
State of West Virginia, who would like to tax the production of synfuel. 

The tax issue is one we will try to solve by pushing back on the equity.

 Arch is no match for the combined legal and lobbying capabilities of the 
large players now in the synfuel business - Florida Power, SCANA, PGE, AIG, 
Sempra, PacifiCorp, Kentucky Utilities, TECO, Keystone Conemaugh, DQE, 
Norfolk Southern, Fannie Mae, Drummond, Peabody (Lehman Bros.), Alliance 
(Chase), Massey (Fluor) and Southern Company Services. In addition Aquila. 
PSE&G, Duke, CP&L, VEPCO, Santee Cooper and others are working to locate 
machines at their river terminal and generation sites.

I will be in Pittsburgh and West Virginia all of next week.  I would like to 
schedule a meeting time for the group, and I will call in - preferably Monday 
mid - afternoon or Tuesday late afternoon.  Angie will coordinate with 
everyone to set a convenient time.

Thanks,

George

George,

I would like to have a brief (30 minute) meeting about the noise in the 
political system about synfuel and reaffirm Jordon's viewpoint on Section 29 
credits.  This is big issue and without this reaffirmation I believe we will 
have approval issues with RAC and others.  I want Jeff and/or I in the 
meeting.

I am looking forward to moving our transportation business into continental

Subject: SIGNED: Redcar Throughput Services Agreement


On August 31 (yesterday) we signed an Agreement with Corus UK Limited 
(formerly British Steel) for Throughput Services at the Redcar Facility in 
northeastern England.  

In exchange for a UKo2.5 million prepay to cover the cost of 750,000 tons of 
planned imports to Redcar, the deal gives Enron:

the right but not the obligation to import up to all available third party 
capacity (ca. 2 million tons per year) at the Redcar Facility for a term of 5 
years;
through an incentivised price schedule, a throughput rate that falls with 
each vessel which passes through the facility;
a price schedule that is not adjusted for inflation during the entire 5 year 
contract term;  
the unrestricted right to resell any or all slots to third parties during the 
5 year contract term;

Coupled with our recent deal with Immingham (5 years of free options for the 
full coal import capacity at new HIT Terminal), Enron Coal Services has a 
unique and unrivalled position in ports and rail vis-a-vis all the major UK 
coal importers.   Together with the recent Freightliner deal, Enron has 
constructed the lowest cost and longest term "Coal Pipeline" to the major UK 
coal-fired generators (pls. see attached map)

As a result, Enron is currently the only coal supplier in the UK with:

5 year call options on the available capacity of Redcar and HIT, the two most 
important coal import facilities in the UK;
the ability to provide competitive rail to our customers from Redcar and 
Immingham. 

We have opted not to publicise this transaction in order not to spook our 
current and potential clients in the Aire and Trent Valleys.   We would 
prefer the market to continue to think that we are offering aggressive 
multi-year delivered coal prices "because we just don't know what we are 
doing."  Thanks for keeping this quiet.  

Many thanks to Steve Pirozzi, John Moran, Pierre Aury, Cornelia Luptowitsch, 
Chris Connelly, Robert Quick, Matt Arnold, Stu Staley and the entire Enron 
Coal Team!

Mike / Jeff -

Please find attached a copy of the slide presentation Eskom (the state owned 
utility in South Africa) will give to the Minister of Energy in early Dec.  
Eskom, as a state owned entity, is involved in the development of the Black 
Economic Empowerment mines (ie New Coal) as well as the traditionally 
white-owned Junior Miners.  Eskom is a strong proponent of the expansion of 
Richards Bay Coal Terminal or alternately the development of South Dunes Coal 
Terminal.

As the Eskom presentation details, Enron is included in their plans to expand 
their role in the RSA coal business regardless of which terminal is 
developed.  Project Springbok is moving along well, and should result in 
increasing flows from South Africa next year.  As a note Tom Kearney (London) 
and Ivan van Niekerk (Joburg) have led this effort.  Ivan is with Enron 
Metals, but it seems we have been able to borrow him on a virtual full time 
basis - he has been great.

Subject: Eskom

George,

Eskom is presenting the attached document informally to the SA Minister of 
Energy over the weekend.   Iscor has approved the concept (but don't know 
Enron is behind it) and the Eskom Enterprises 
Board has approved it (who do know we are behind the concept).

Under the structure of the transaction, in exchange for providing the same 
throughput guarantees as other SDCT members, Enron would be allocated up to 2 
mta of the expanded RBCT allocation in perpetuity.  For a limited period 
(Francois mentioned 5 years), Black Economic Empowerment coal projects 
approved by Enron/Eskom/Govt. would have first call on the Enron 
allocation.     In addition, if it so chooses, Enron would be responsible for 
marketing the BEE coal in export markets.  Enron would become a full-fledged 
member of the SDCT and would be represented on the RBCT Board by an SDCT 
representative (which could be Enron as well).  

Bottom Line:  This is our informal invite to the dance.  RBCT is supposed to 
formally communicate with SDCT about expansion on December 6.  On December 7 
the SDCT interest group meets.  Shortly after that, Eskom will make this 
proposal to government on a formal basis and then, if Government and SDCT 
members approve, Enron will be invited to join the SDCT as a formal member.  

Let the games begin!

board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Mike,

As a result of the recent reorganization, initially I will be responsible for 
the Weather and Insurance trading activities.  I look forward to working with 
you in these efforts.

What I really wanted to talk to you about is the JDF Walk.  Last year we 
discovered that our 2 1/2 year old son, Brandon, had diabetes.  As you 
remember, and certainly can relate to, this changed our lives forever.  In 
retrospect, I am glad that I got involved in Enron's effort even though it 
was in the last 3-4 weeks.  We have continued to stay involved with JDF by 
attending several events, by visiting the JDF office, and by JDF's proactive 
phone out-reach.  I would like to hear your take on sponsoring a team through 
Enron vs. directly through JDF.  I know that Enron matches the contributions 
if sponsored through Enron; is this possible if we were to go the other route?

Please call or email as I know we are approaching the campaign time.

Thanks,
Todd Hall

By now all of you should have received an invitation to the JDF 2000 Walk to 
Cure Diabetes Kick-Off Luncheon on Wednesday, September 6th, 11:30 a.m. - 
1:00 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  I would like to take this opportunity

My sincerest thanks to all of you that were able to attend the JDF Kick-off 
Luncheon on September 6th.  It was a great event and a wonderful opportunity 
for those of you not familiar with JDF to find out what the JDF Walk is all 
about.  For those of you that were not able to join us, we missed you and we 
look forward to having you join us for our future sessions.

The Enron/JDF Team Leaders Kick-off Luncheon will take place on Wednesday, 
September 13th, at the Houston Metropolitan Racquet Club (The Met) beginning 
at 11:30 a.m.  I would like to encourage each of you to mark your calendar 
and make plans to attend this very important luncheon meeting.  At this 
kick-off meeting we will be distributing supplies and gift bags, reviewing 
important details about our campaign, learning more about JDF, and discussing 
our fundraising goal for this year's campaign.  Enron has been the number 1 
walk team in Houston for 5 years in a row and we plan to continue in that 
position and we need your help to make it happen!  

Please take just a moment to RSVP your attendance via e-mail to Rachel Feldt 
on the Corporate Lotus Notes directory or to rachel.feldt@enron.com.

The Steering Committee members for this year's campaign are listed below.  
Please feel free to contact me or any Steering Committee member if you have 
any questions or if you have friends that you would like to sign up to help 
with our campaign.

Mike, I too am an insulin dependent diabetic for the past 27 years ( since 
age 7 ) and would be very interested in helping with your group.  Not really 
sure what I can accomplish with EGM from my Charleston, WV location but know 
that I am interested.

Kids are my concern as well.  In fact, I am coaching my sons soccer team and 
have a 5 year old diabetic on my team.

Just a thought for you.................I have been on an insulin pump for the 
past 7 years and it has made a tremendous difference for my life.  Certainly 
worth exploring if you are not using one.  Also, my brother ( Bank of America 
employee ) is on the ADA board for the Southeast region if you may wish to 
contact him about speakers ( doctors ).

Having said the above, I pledge $ 250.00 for the cause.

Mike:
 
 How does one make contributions to JDF when stationed overseas?  I am here 
in Tokyo with EnCom and participated in the walks before moving overseas.  
Kathy Knott is an old high school friend and got me interested in JDF some 
years ago.

Thanks, 

Carey Sloan

Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Fundraising

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Mike McConnell

Jeff, as we talked earlier we need to get what you want ASAP because in these 
energy markets , which I think we both agree are not going to settle down any 
time soon, coupled with the growth you and Mike want to see we are operating 
under ridiculously small limits. 8 million VAR for a group our size , with 
our turnover and number of traders just doesn't work. We have 15 to 20 
million of structured deals, primarlily coming from Don S that at this time 
we would have to walk away from. We can not go out and recruit more and 
better traders to have them sit at their desk and not trade do to limits 
which in no way are reflective of the size and risk Enron should be willing 
to take if they truly have bought into this being a significant global 
business. I  suggest they should have raised them already as a reflection of 
where they want to take the business and thought this through prior to the 
move  to Global Markets. You wouldn't be handed a Model T and asked to go out 
and win the Indy 500. We need the tools to make the money and VAR is just as 
important a componenet as leadership,  people, vol limits, systems 
,reporting, etc. 
 We have shut down positions  today, which will cost us significantly, due to 
the VAR issue.  All we seem to be doing now is trading and worrying about VAR 
and NOT doing what we think is right with our positions. This definitely, 
like today, has had a negative impact on P/L.We will get a chance to visit 
this issue  with Chris and John on your visit here next week.
